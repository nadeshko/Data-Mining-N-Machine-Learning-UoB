third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title empirical equation 
resonant frequency coupling coefficient 
microstrip single-spiral resonators 
student name sumaira khan supervisor 
fh project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
microstrip spiral resonators filters 
currently designed computer simulation 
lengthy process helpful empirical design 
equations similar those straight microstrip 
least provide initial design feasibility 
study can done fitting curves simulated 
results probably using sonnet electromagnetic 
simulator useful equations must valid 
wide range permittivity number turns 
substrate thickness etc expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  1 provide 
empirical design equations together 
simulation data demonstrate validity 
2 use physical arguments show proportionality 
other simple relationship between some 
parameters resonant frequency thereby 
simplifying equations 3 review theory 
resonant transmission lines use 2 4 demonstrate 
knowledge sonnet other electromagnetic 
simulator fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  provide design data form 
graphs  review theory resonant transmission 
lines  demonstrate knowledge sonnet 
other electromagnetic simulator enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
expected outcomes extend work coupling 
coefficients between spirals project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm 
uniqueness project placing tick adjacent 
box other than learning standard theory 
software enough unique material provided 
expected outcomes met
