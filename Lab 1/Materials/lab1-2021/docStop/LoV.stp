third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 proposed project title pulse 
generator controlling laser student 
name vincent lo supervisor tim jackson 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist want 
flexible pulse generator bnc cable output 
send ttl pulses control laser thin films 
lab like able choose pulse frequencies 
0.1 100 hz pulse generator used provide 
reliable process control up 5000 pulses 
may need sent any one process expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 design circuit and/or program make prototype 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 design explanation why how work enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 working unit pulse bunching modulation 
create bursts 5 10 pulses up total number 
5000 pulses frequency pulses within 
bunch range 0.1-100hz separation between 
pulses able chosen between 1 10 seconds 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm 
uniqueness project placing tick adjacent
