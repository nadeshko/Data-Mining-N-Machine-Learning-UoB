third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title environment 
mapping using autonomous vehicle student 
name arafat ben hassine supervisor smc 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist many 
environments hostile hazardous situations 
present significant risk injury death 
where tasks must still performed scenarios 
like these autonomous systems becoming 
increasingly important addition providing 
necessary equipment perform desired 
function such systems need able cope 
novel possibly dynamic circumstances 
applications may found variety fields 
civil emergency services range military 
operations similar intelligence once 
proven could also used labour-saving 
consumer electronics expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  aim project 
design build demonstrate autonomous 
vehicle capable mapping unknown environment 
into placed given specified range vehicle 
should attempt physically cover much 
ground possible within defined range 
minimum possible time whilst ensuring 
its own safety i.e avoiding obstacles 
pitfalls entail development sensor-equipped 
intelligent vehicle algorithms designed 
efficiently control vehicle's movement 
mapping tasks vehicle should create 
map environment encountered should 
recoverable vehicle's return fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  design 
build demonstrate autonomous microcontroller-based 
vehicle support collision detection 
collision avoidance  design implement 
evaluate algorithms mapping static 
environment goal covering 100 specified 
region whilst avoiding unnecessary 
collisions  investigate impact capabilities 
vehicle design effectiveness algorithms 
used control enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  extend functionality vehicle 
include detection pitfalls well obstacles 
distinguish between obstacles may negotiated 
those cannot  implement serial interface 
vehicle allowing vehicle receive instructions 
return information computer via rs-232 
link  design implement evaluate algorithms 
mapping dynamic environment returning 
vehicle its point departure project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
