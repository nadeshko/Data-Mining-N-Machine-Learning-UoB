third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title monitoring 
high-bandwidth encrypted data streams 
student name choon yik lok supervisor 
smc project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
recent project demonstrated speech 
recognition hardware feasible allows 
automatic electronic eavesdropping 
providing communication channels encrypted 
thus demand high-speed encryption decryption 
field-programmable gate arrays fpgas 
demonstrated suitable technology both 
implementing switching fabrics high-bandwidth 
networks also cryptographic algorithms 
maximum efficiency these functions 
should combined thus making use massive 
on-chip bandwidth offered modern fpgas 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project design implement evaluate 
fpga-based stream processor capable 
extracting selected packets incoming 
data stream decrypting them range cryptographic 
algorithms targeting xilinx virtex-e 
series field programmable gate arrays 
fpgas should evaluated range should 
include helix recently-announced encryption/authentication 
algorithm counterpane internet security 
evaluation should consider performance 
fpga-based system relation software 
implementations also efficiency algorithms 
can mapped into hardware fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  demonstrate using 
rc1000 coprocessors available encryption 
decryption using simple symmetric block 
cipher such tea rc5  demonstrate selective 
extraction data packets continuous 
data stream using switching fabric implemented 
rc1000  design implement test program 
synthesize packet-based data stream 
allowing user selectively insert payload 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  use two rc1000 coprocessors 
demonstrate selective encryption decryption 
data carried over high-bandwidth packet-based 
network  design construct test adapter 
allowing two rc1000 coprocessors connected 
together via general-purpose i/o headers 
 develop protocol inter-processor communication 
over link goal maximizing achievable 
bandwidth project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
