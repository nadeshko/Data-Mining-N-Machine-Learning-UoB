third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title:an active antenna 
testbed software defined radio student 
name lim seok lian supervisor pg project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist software defined 
radio important topic modern radio development 
important potential application area 
active integrated antenna technology 
active integrated antennas potential 
produce miniaturized integrated radio 
transmitters receivers active passive 
circuit functions achieved same medium 
antenna high levels integration between 
functions expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design  aim project set 
up comms link signal generator used transmitter 
patch antenna receiver including integrated 
lna mixer a/d converter reveived signals 
analysed using spectrum analyzer oscilloscope 
verify link budget calculations fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  design 
build test patch antennas tx rx ends system 
 enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  capture analyse digital 
signal enable software demodulation 
bpsk qpsk modulation  measure bit error 
rate after software demodulation compare 
theoretical predictions project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project
