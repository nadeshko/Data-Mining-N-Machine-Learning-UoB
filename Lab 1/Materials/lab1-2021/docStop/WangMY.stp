third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title detection out-of-vocabulary 
word student name min ying wang supervisor 
peter jancovic project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
word-based automatic speech recognition 
system can recognize words limited-vocabulary 
interesting many real-world applications 
however considering practical employment 
such system user may pronounce word included 
vocabulary recognition system  such 
word referred out-of-vocabulary oov 
similarly presence non-stationary 
noise asr system may understand speech 
signal project investigate ways detecting 
oov words expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project investigate some 
methods detection oov words concern 
isolated digit recognition using hmm-based 
speech recognition system trained hmm 
models each vocabulary word provided 
database parameterized speech utterances 
provided input program parameterized 
file trained hmm models student should 
implement viterbi algorithm used recognition 
phase viterbi algorithm sequence likelihood 
values sequence occupancy each hmm-state 
should obtained statistics these two 
parameters based training data should 
obtained these then used detect whether 
input speech utterance oov word methods 
should implemented c c language preferably 
matlab environment fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  program developed 
matlab environment  least one method 
implemented evaluated i.e either using 
sequence likelihood values sequence 
state occupancies  statistics based 
training-data obtained enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 both sequence likelihoods sequence 
hmm-state occupancies should employed 
evaluated  tuning parameters within 
above-described methods investigated 
complete evaluation some standard speech 
database performed  implementation 
comparison one other method oov word 
detection project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
