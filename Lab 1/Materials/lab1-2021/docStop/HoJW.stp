third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title dielectric 
resonators hakki-coleman configuration 
student name ms j w ho supervisor dr p smith 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist dielectric 
resonator dr simply cylindrical piece 
ceramic acts resonant structure its 
length diameter become approximately 
equal multiple 1/2 wavelength dielectric 
resonators widely used basestation 
receivers filter elements mobile phone 
systems project involve use software 
package matlab model dielectric resonator 
metal plates top bottom faces hakki-coleman 
configuration project involve significant 
amount matlab modelling well fair amount 
mathematical derivation expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  aim project 
 predict frequency te011 mode dr hakki 
coleman configuration along other tm 
hybrid modes  determine permittivity 
actual samples  predict q hakki coleman 
structure compare actual measurements 
taking into account conductor dielectric 
loss  finally software used calculate 
tan d actual ceramic samples fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  predict 
frequency te011 mode dr hakki coleman 
configuration  determine permittivity 
actual samples enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  calculate q 
tm hybrid modes taking into account conductor 
dielectric losses  project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
