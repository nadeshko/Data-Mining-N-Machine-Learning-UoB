third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title software routines 
testing diagnostics jaguar's body system 
network student name m abbasi supervisor 
clive roberts project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
project design construct scp standard 
corporate protocol test diagnostic 
tool jaguar scp bespoke communication 
protocol similar functionality can 
network analysis tool jest jaguar engineering 
scp tool already exists used ford scp 
however jest's functionality incorporated 
into software based automated test diagnostic 
routines scp currently used body system 
network jaguar vehicle body system network 
provides control locking seat position 
lighting control etc expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  aim project 
design construct series software routines 
automated test diagnostics scp network 
routines should capable monitoring 
transmitting automating diagnostics 
scp network particular system should 
able display decode messages passing 
across network these appear bus hex format 
need converted into meaningful text 
using pre-existing database addition 
system should able transmit single cyclic 
messages probe scp modules fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  design 
test diagnostic software routines monitoring 
transmission messages scp network  develop 
means monitoring messages scp network 
 log network traffic disk enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 monitoring function should allow filtering 
certain message types multiple instance 
filtering functionality should available 
any one time  ability develop macros provide 
basic means configuring software via 
script file could included project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
