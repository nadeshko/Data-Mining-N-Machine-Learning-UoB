project title:motionless detector 
student name:dekha swanston supervisor:ms 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist often 
useful detect inactivity particularly 
field search rescue typical scenario 
fireman entering burning building low 
visibility because smoke clearly inactive 
some length time possibility overcome 
smoke inhalation simple detector can 
detect zero motion useful monitoring 
device these situations expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  project 
involves building device can detect 
state zero motion such device use example 
emergency service personnel work enclosed 
areas maybe aftermath earthquake fire 
device could attached someone rendered 
unconscious motionless detector could 
emit radio signal central control point 
possibly location information clearly 
intelligence should built into device 
only emits emergency signal after being 
motionless state after certain length 
time fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 simple device outputs signal moved some 
programmable length time  interfacing 
pic lcd display displays motion history 
operative id  interfacing buzzer/alarm 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  outputting radio signal 
central control operator id info location 
info  communication network operatives 
alerting nearest operative project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
