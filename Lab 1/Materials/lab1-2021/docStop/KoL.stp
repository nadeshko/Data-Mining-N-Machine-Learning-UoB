 2003/2004 project title mobile intelligent 
tutoring system offer daily learning 
opportunities student name lisa ko supervisor 
susan bull project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
handheld computers provide opportunities 
computer-based educational interactions 
times where kind learning normally possible 
intelligent tutoring system adapts 
educational interaction specific needs 
individual user according model understanding 
constructs during interaction learner 
model typically contains representations 
learner's knowledge difficulties any 
misconceptions hold combining flexibility 
mobile learning individualised learning 
possibilities offered intelligent 
tutoring systems benefit learners move 
features specific mobile learning can 
modelled order create intelligent tutoring 
system only allows personalised learning 
opportunities also takes into account 
amount time available learner location 
learning can then recommend most appropriate 
learning interaction individual according 
learning needs daily schedule expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 project design implement evaluate mobile 
intelligent tutoring system system 
model learner's knowledge misconceptions 
learning locations levels concentration 
distraction start each day student input 
how many learning sessions plan complete 
length time available each session location 
system then plan suitable series interactions 
day according contents learner model 
learner's schedule e.g information 
presentation test questions individualised 
tutoring remediation need adapt remainder 
day's learning plan learner misses session 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 implementation basic mobile intelligent 
tutoring system without additional 
schedule information  implementation 
static learning material presented 
appropriate user's location and/or 
time available without detailed modelling 
knowledge misconceptions enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
many ways project could enhanced following 
examples only  use calendar infer use 
current day offered default user confirm 
 inference previous usage patterns about 
location time use current day offered 
default user confirm  inference concentration/distraction 
levels various locations based previous 
interactions those locations project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
