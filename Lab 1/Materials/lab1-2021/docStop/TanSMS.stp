third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title modelling dielectric 
resonators communications applications 
student name sms tan supervisor dr p smith 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist dielectric 
resonators widely used basestation 
receivers filter elements mobile communication 
systems project involve use software 
packages superfish mathcad model dielectric 
resonators different permittivity's 
shapes different sized cavity housings 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim find optimum size cavity housing 
shape dielectric resonator dr conductor 
losses cavity walls reduced optimum 
q achieved need repeated range different 
permittivity's such 29.5 36 45 time permits 
few dielectric resonators permittivities 
29.5 36 43 may measured metallic cavities 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 analysis cavity wall losses considered 
cylindrical dielectric resonators 
 enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  analysis effect different 
dr shapes q e.g spherical cavity housing 
spherical dr  possibly using ferrite 
sample tune resonant frequency dr ferrite 
structure  possibly using dr measurement 
system extract losses ceramic substrate 
materials project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
