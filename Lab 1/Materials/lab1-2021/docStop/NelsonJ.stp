third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title voice controlled 
robot student name j nelson supervisor 
prof m.j russell project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
aim project design construct small compact 
speech controlled mobile robot able 
respond voice commands such go stop left 
right etc necessitate design implementation 
evaluation speech recognition unit 
either robot pc drive unit control movement 
microprocessor do processing chassis 
put robot itself already designed part 
previous project expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  1 understand 
basic speech recognition technology 
2 decide system design issues off-robot 
speech recognition microphone location 
microphone-to-recogniser comms recognizer-to-robot 
comms etc 3 implementation testing robot 
robot mobile wheels connected stepper 
motors connected microprocessor enable 
movement 4 implementation testing speech 
recognition 5 system integration using 
wire link between pc robot fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  minimum targets items 
1,2 3 5 text commands robot simulate output 
speech recogniser enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  wireless lan 
between robot pc sr pc commands sent robot 
via wireless link  complex set spoken 
commands project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
