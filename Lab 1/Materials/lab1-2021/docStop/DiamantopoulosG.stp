project title:event detection video 
student name:george diamantopoulos 
supervisor:ms project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
event detection video relatively new 
area research aimed detecting significant 
events video sequence these events wide 
definition can cover such things person 
entering doorway car changing lanes 
motorway person getting into car driving 
away clearly definition event generally 
determine type image processing required 
detect event however similar sense real-time 
near real-time detection required because 
detection normally triggers some action 
such alarm being sounded also generally 
involve element object tracking prior 
actual event adds robustness system 
object identification such identifying 
person reliable can tracked over number 
frames expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  project aimed detecting one particular 
type event  tailgating through car park 
barrier normally single vehicle enters 
parking area barrier then closes however 
second vehicle following quickly behind 
first can enter whilst barrier still 
up situation relatively similar normal 
situation single vehicle entering represents 
challenging scenario detection envisaged 
any system produced bolted existing 
cctv system relatively low quality greylevel 
video purposes project capture our own 
footage develop detection system triggers 
alarm event detected fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  record/play sequence 
 compute thresholded frame difference 
 determine car enters car park area stops 
then re-enters enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  complete working 
system  differentiation between different 
vehicle types  evaluation live cctv link 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
