third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title design construction 
measurement system determine permittivity 
typical circuit boards student name 
mr peter schutz supervisor dr p smith 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist polymer 
low r ceramic circuit boards often found 
unlabelled both academic industrial 
environments therefore need determine 
permittivity these boards easily done 
using expensive equipment such impedance 
analyzer such equipment heavily demand 
usually very portable expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  aim project 
design build test system measure permittivity 
low r boards using relatively inexpensive 
equipment consideration given nature 
test sample coated metal both sides one 
side only bare board how information 
about sample entered how results displayed 
how capacitance obtained fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  test system only able 
measure samples fixed geometry  system 
only able measure samples metallised 
both sides enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  system user-friendly interface 
allow entry data  test jig include some 
form calibration system take effects 
such fringing fields around edge etc 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm 
uniqueness project placing tick adjacent
