 2003/2004 project title comparative 
study cuk converter student name kee 
wong supervisor svmollov project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
cuk converter nowadays used high power 
rectifier project want study performance 
three possible topologies expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 compare performance three types cuk 
converter po=200w vo=15v vin=50v fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  design 
cuk converter conventional circuit 
transformer isolated circuit integrated 
magnetics circuit  enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  build test conventional 
cuk converter 2.2  build test transformer 
isolated cuk converter 2.1  build test 
integrated magnetics converter first 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project
