third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title microwave microscopy 
student name jiann yih horace chong supervisor 
tim jackson project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
microwave microscope based co-axial 
quarter wavelength resonator built 
research lab want simulate change resonant 
frequency microscope sample brought 
up tip different materials different 
dielectric constants want compare results 
frequency calculations published theory 
student begin reminding himself electric 
field inside co-axial cable meaning 
resonance meaning dielectric constant 
change capacitance two parallel plates 
dielectric material placed between 
them expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  use superfish program calculations 
graph frequency shift versus dielectric 
constant compare graph theory try different 
geometries tip compare again try bi-layer 
samples compare again fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  use superfish program 
calculations  graph frequency shift 
versus dielectric constant enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 try different geometries tip compare 
again try bi-layer samples compare again 
 try samples lateral confinement project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm 
uniqueness project placing tick adjacent
