third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title driving styles 
versus fuel consumption emissions student 
name zakaria angelo supervisor mo project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist often stated 
reduction driving speed smoother driving 
style result fuel economy increased 
road security however studies energetic 
systems show relationship between speed 
fuel consumption  emission rather complex 
sometimes reducing speed result fuel 
consumption emission therefore desirable 
analyse effect different driving styles 
fuel consumption  emission expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project investigate influence different 
driving fuel consumption emissions 
different literature results exhibited 
simulation provides basis driver training 
programs other hand suggests theoretical 
basis interpreting cause/accident 
database fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  investigate summarize appropriate 
literature field fuel consumption/emission 
versus speed  provide basis interpreting 
different driving styles  re-interpret 
database road accident causes  design 
implement simulation platform summarizes 
results supply guidelines driver training 
community enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  implement improved simulation 
platform incorporates cinematic car 
 investigate effect traffic flow respect 
driving styles  design setup your own 
car provides preliminary results project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
