third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title 30mhz inverter 
student name yee tiong supervisor svmollov 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist mosfets 
very difficult switch around beyond 
10mhz industrial processes require 
sine waveforms 27mhz suggested inverter 
exploits interesting idea based harmonic 
multiplication cancellation expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 build test inverter 30mhz get mosfets 
switch 10mhz input voltage 50-300v fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  design 
inverter inclusive inductive components 
 design gate drivers signal generator 
 full schematic inclusive auxiliary 
citcuits enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  build test gate driver 2.2 
 build test invert pole 50v 10mhz 2.1  build 
test inverter 50-300v 30mhz first project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm 
uniqueness project placing tick adjacent 
box yes
