third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title wifi experimental 
testbed student name e brady supervisor 
ccc project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
project design implement validate peer-to-peer 
wireless network testbed using up 20 
pdas aim user choose various settings 
such mac protocol metrics recorded each 
node traffic sources routing protocol 
finally define topology manipulating 
available radio connectivity between 
nodes expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  software framework following 
implemented designed single mac layer 
protocol can used build link state tables 
nodes connectivity nodes can only specified 
centralised manner master node defined 
user simplest traffic sources e.g constant 
bit rate just udp implemented small number 
simple routing algorithms implemented 
finally simple end-to-end path packet 
loss delay measurements taken processed 
centrally rudimentary validation testbed 
software expected fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  traffic source just 
collection ping messages  routing data 
implemented using simplest algorithms 
worst case through restricted flooding 
 simple measurements reported histogram 
form without any statistical analysis 
being performed enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  sophisticated 
set routing performance metrics enabled 
nodes  connectivity can controlled decentralised 
manner  statistical analysis various 
measurements implemented fully  than 
one mac layer protocol selectable testbed 
 extensive validation testbed software 
carried project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
