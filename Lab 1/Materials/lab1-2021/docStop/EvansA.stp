third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title coupling capacitance 
end-coupled orthogonal microstrip 
lines student name agbamu evans supervisor 
fh project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
above coupling capacitances previously 
calculated using quasi-static methods 
now verified using electromagnetic 
simulator although also done previous 
project user-friendly software should 
now enable much further progress made 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 1.design data mainly coupling capacitances 
provided range gap sizes line widths 
substrate permittivities compared 
results available literature 2 upper 
frequency limit quasi-static model 
evaluated data 3 use electromagnetic 
simulator calculations based data obtained 
explained fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  items 1 3 above enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 high-frequency model based several 
lumped elements created  size region 
interaction between two microstrips 
assuming given accuracy determined 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm 
uniqueness project placing tick adjacent 
box other than learning standard theory 
software enough unique material provided 
expected outcomes met
