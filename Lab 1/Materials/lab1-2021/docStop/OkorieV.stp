third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title robust microcontroller 
networks advanced automotive systems 
student name victor okorie supervisor 
smc project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
modern automotive systems incorporate 
widely distributed intelligence form 
networks microcontrollers intelligence 
used increase safety performance comfort 
some functions performed safety-critical 
such control airbags anti-lock brakes 
others e.g control reversing aids audio 
equipment air conditioning less essential 
achieve high reliability redundant 
systems often used increasing hardware 
costs reducing efficiency development 
fault-tolerant systems use minimal 
amount redundant hardware along techniques 
detecting fault conditions identifying 
cause then adapting system behaviour 
order minimise loss function therefore 
interest expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project design implement 
evaluate microcontroller-based test 
network consists sensor processing 
display nodes connected such way faults 
can detected processing responsibilities 
redistributed allow system continue 
operate correctly event failure some 
component system sensor nodes capable 
measuring physical quantity temperature 
voltage etc communicating another node 
display nodes simply receive information 
display appropriately processing nodes 
manipulate information monitor other 
nodes control actuators within system 
network type containing number nodes 
each capable simulating faults e.g loss 
communications channel should demonstrated 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 investigate inter-processor communication 
alternatives available constructing 
networks based microchip pic microcontrollers 
 investigate possible fault conditions 
also techniques both fault detection 
fault injection within such network 
 demonstrate simple network consisting 
one sensor node one display node two processing 
nodes one should adopt responsibilities 
other upon failure enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  extend capabilities 
system additional sensor types greater 
number processing nodes larger number 
potential faults  reduce maintenance 
overheads collating information multiple 
sources accurately diagnosing cause 
faults within system project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
