third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title active infra-red 
intrusion monitoring system student 
name phillip hughes supervisor smc project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist early intrusion 
detection technology could only indicate 
whether door opened window broken warm 
body inhabited room embedding intelligence 
within security devices allows far wider 
range problems solved detecting motion 
within protected space passive infra-red 
technologies commonly used however 
protected space cannot easily modified 
behaviour any warm bodies detected cannot 
easily determined example might useful 
know point intruder entered protected 
space active infra-red sensors coupled 
embedded intelligence form microcontroller 
promise solution both these limitations 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project design construct test intelligent 
intrusion monitoring system using active 
infra-red sensors capable monitoring 
user-defined region within room storing 
information relating disturbances 
off-line analysis protected space should 
programmable run-time steps must taken 
ensure minimum number either false-positive 
false-negative results system should 
capable monitoring its protected space 
over period time reporting direction 
intruder first entered protected space 
defined should possible interrogate 
system directly gain access information 
stored fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 investigate use active infra-red sensors 
indoor environments propose methods 
overcoming background levels infra-red 
 demonstrate simple intrusion detection 
system programmable via keypad displays 
time alarm last triggered lcd display 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  extend capabilities system 
include keeping track regions within 
protected space rather than just directions 
 demonstrate system capable detecting 
reporting both time approximate point 
entry into protected space  add rs-232 
interface system allow information 
stored transferred easily workstation 
off-line analysis project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
