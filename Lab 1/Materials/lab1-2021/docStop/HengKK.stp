third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title multi-static 
sonar sensor student name kai koon heng 
supervisor pra project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
low-frequency high-power active sonar 
systems currently under political scrutiny 
resulting probable links damage caused 
marine mammals thus likely these systems 
banned within next ten years candidate 
technologies replace these systems 
include purely passive sonar systems 
large-networks very low-power active 
sensors expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project design build programmable 
signal source suitable use low-power 
acoustic network beacon likely such 
beacon cycle through number pre-programmed 
waveforms using different frequency 
bands device should programmable pc 
particular consideration should given 
low-power operation device battery 
operated fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  select suitable low-power 
high-resolution digital-to-analogue 
converter test device simple test signals 
square-waves  implement simple programmable 
device capable downloading test waveform 
pc  interface d/a programmable device 
demonstrate downloaded test signal 
output oscilloscope enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  ensure transmitted 
signal does suffer unnecessary timing 
jitter undertake mathematical analysis 
comparison performance waveform generator 
 implement matching receiver  demonstrate 
working technical-demonstrator bistatic 
sonar system probably using matlab pc 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
