third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title adaptive segmentation 
moving objects student name jonathan 
soden supervisor mo project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
segmentation necessary step any image 
processing oriented application classically 
segmentation based thresholding over 
grey value image data set unfortunately 
such approach shown its limitation dealing 
moving targets changing illumination 
like video type applications project 
attempts implement test feasibility 
new technique recently developed mit 
shows performances method compared 
some standard segmentation methods 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project implement test feasibility 
new segmentation based method moving 
objects suggested platform based pc 
using any programming language suitable 
student i.e matlab c/c while data set 
arises some on-line source fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  algorithmic 
construction new segmentation based 
approach  show sufficient understanding 
theory segmentation modeling stage 
 show sufficient understanding application 
approach real images  quantification 
limit advantages approach compared 
others enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  integration approach real 
time like application  proposals improving 
approach based observed limitation 
feasibility study project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
