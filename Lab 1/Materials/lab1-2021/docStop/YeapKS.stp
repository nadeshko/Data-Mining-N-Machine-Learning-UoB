third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title flux mill sensor 
student name kuen shin yeap supervisor 
pra project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
naturally occurring electric fields 
result reduced yield reliability semiconductor 
manufacturing industry similarly electrical 
fields laboratories electronic manufacturing 
plants lead early demise many integrated 
circuits larger scale sunspots resulting 
solar winds can lead major parts national 
power distribution networks becoming 
unstable thus important able measure 
static electrical fields high degree 
accuracy  very difficult task expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project design build electric flux 
mill sensor based work chubb ideally 
rotating flux mill should connected 
incremental encoder order accurately 
measure position output sensor should 
preferably interfaced high-resolution 
24-bit analogue-to-digital converter 
correlation operation then implemented 
software possibly matlab c order implement 
narrow-band tracking-filter fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  implement 
rotating-vane flux-mill mechanism 
 measure position vane using incremental 
encoder  measure induced voltage using 
24-bit analogue-to-digital converter 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  undertake mathematical 
analysis comparison performance different 
know flux mill sensors  consider suitable 
ways interfacing acquired digital data 
pc simple low-cost ways using usb firewire 
etc  demonstrate complete working electric 
field sensor project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
