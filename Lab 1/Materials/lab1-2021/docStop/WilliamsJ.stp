third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title automatic language 
identification student name john williams 
supervisor peter jancovic project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
each language its own characteristic 
patterns sounds sequences sounds language 
identification can employed instance 
first step multi-lingual machine translation 
system expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project develop program automatic 
language identification based speech 
signal student should collect speech 
database various languages program 
should implemented c c language input 
program parameterized speech signal 
tool parameterization speech signal 
provided program consist two phases 
training operation training phase acoustic 
models each language estimated using 
gaussian mixture modeling gmm performed 
clean speech database gmm tool provided 
after gmms trained evaluation training 
data these models should performed  results 
class-assignment should then used train 
n-gram language model operation input 
speech different length unknown language 
should evaluated using trained gmms 
n-gram language model addition use speech 
signal n-gram modelling each language 
based text data should obtained fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  program 
developed matlab environment  evaluation 
simple gmm-based language-identification 
system performed  speech data least 3 
languages collected possibly same speaker 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  training n-gram modeling 
performed its incorporation recognition 
phase evaluation  fundamental frequency 
may useful feature language identification 
tone languages particular implement 
method estimation fundamental frequency 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
