them assist individuals adapt teaching 
strategy needs group  peers enable students 
compare progress against group learner 
model accessed differently these diverse 
groups form  simple negotiable model 
student  editable model instructor  inspectable 
only model peers fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  implementation inspectable-only 
learner model user groups enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
many ways project could enhanced following 
examples only  user-provided restrictions/permissions
