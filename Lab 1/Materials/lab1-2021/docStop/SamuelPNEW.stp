outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  working 
hardware software cover least one octave 
musical scale fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  working hardware cover least 
two notes enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  study whether harmonics 
voice slowly-varying pitch transient 
notes affect circuit  use down-samplers 
implement additional octaves scale 
minimal increase amount code reduced 
truncation error project uniqueness
