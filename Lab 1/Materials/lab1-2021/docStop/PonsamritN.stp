third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title building speaker 
recognition system control access room 
student name n ponsamrit id 319935 supervisor 
prof m russell project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
many security systems prevent unauthorized 
person accessing private areas such 
eye scanning fingerprint security code 
keys cards speech most comfortable system 
use speaker recognition system because 
no physical contact i.e eye scanning 
fingerprint people might uncomfortable 
equipment needed necessary speech data 
minimal disadvantage system accuracy 
varies influenced factors such emotion 
health etc lots speaker recognition 
applications used present its advantages 
no specific training user needed can 
used unusual situations e.g darkness 
blindness etc also speech could advantages 
access control disabled people enable 
access houses control household equipment 
using speech expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design   understand how 
speaker recognition system works  design 
implement evaluate speaker recognition 
system using matlab c htk  design implement 
evaluate simple device controlled speaker 
recognition e.g light led authorized 
speaker talking  design implement evaluate 
simple demo shows how speaker recognition 
system can used control piece hardware 
system integration fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  understand how speaker 
recognition system works  design implement 
evaluate speaker recognition system 
using matlab c htk enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  port speaker 
recognition system real-time system 
using hapi  design build demo evaluate 
speaker recognition system piece hardware 
interface speaker recognition system 
real electronic lock e.g using fsm etc 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
