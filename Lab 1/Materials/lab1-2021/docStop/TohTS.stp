 2003/2004 project title motor control 
laboratory experiment student name 
ts toh supervisor dr j forsyth project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist support teaching 
second year electrical power new lab 
experiment required enable students 
study operation control both brushed 
brushless dc motors expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  two loop 
controller power converter designed 
built tested small brushed dc motor coupled 
brushless machine giving possibility 
demonstrating motoring regenerative 
operation fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  basic system understood 
design completed  dc-dc converter operational 
basic control loops implemented  enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 robust system design well understood 
 operation motor regenerative modes 
 computer control system project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project
