ccc project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
proliferation bluetooth ad hoc wlan 
802.11b devices opens possibility sophisticated 
methods cheating during university 
examinations project design built test 
detector unauthorized transmissions 
rooms where examinations being held 
detector single-band device operating 
2.4 ghz ism band three output indicators 
no transmission active wlan transmission 
active bluetooth transmission respectively 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project design hand-held battery-powered 
detector capable producing binary detection 
transmissions signal strength indicator 
ideally can identify type transmission 
e.g bluetooth ieee802.11b etc detector 
comprise two parts radio frequency down-converter 
i.f baseband decision circuit varied 
sophistication complexity battery 
lifetime device must least 3 hours fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  study 
wifi bluetooth standards  design build 
r.f sub-system off-the-shelf components 
 design build basic signal strength detector 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  being able identify type 
transmission  implement intelligent/flexible 
decision circuit/sub-system  consider 
extension multi-band detection include 
mobile phones etc project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
