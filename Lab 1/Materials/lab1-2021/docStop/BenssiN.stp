third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title mobile communications 
link budget calcualtions student name 
n benssi supervisor mjl project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
link budget calculations required mobile 
communications network planning calculations 
based power conservation system taking 
into account possible losses between 
transmitter receiver such calculation 
also taking into account noise provides 
estimate range base station multiple 
base stations provides complete network 
planning tool expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design  project provide 
basic planning tool mobile communications 
networks final outcome program represents 
network graphically single base station 
graphical interface allow entry parameters 
such phone power cable losses receiver 
sensitivity others then generate range 
base station show graphically fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  use limited 
number parameters calculation rather 
than parameters required realistic 
simulation  calculation excel spread 
sheet enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  graphical representation 
multiple base stations  network optimization 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
