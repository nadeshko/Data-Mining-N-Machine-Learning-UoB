third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title dielectric 
spiral resonators student name mr c y 
wong supervisor dr p smith project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
many filters high frequencies resonators 
made some kind transmission line structure 
e.g 1/2 wavelength coaxial resonator 
recent work demonstrated principle 
ceramic sufficiently high permittivity 
can exclude electric field within ceramic 
hence behave rather like metal principle 
used replace metal coaxial inner one 
made ceramic achieve significant increase 
q work look other promising structures 
such spirals made high permittivity 
ceramic latter might still achieve moderate 
q small volume project probably use finite 
difference package simulate spirals 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project perform electromagnetic 
modeling metallic ceramic spirals using 
finite element package metallic spirals 
simple analytic formulae used literature 
design spirals resonant communication 
bands these metallic spirals then simulated 
finite element package determine q resonant 
frequency comparisons then made corresponding 
spirals made ceramic see same modes occur 
what q's can achieved practical measurements 
may taken metallic spirals suitable 
test fixture can designed time fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  modeling 
metallic helices undertaken determine 
resonant frequency q  metallic spirals 
ceramic loading may modeled above enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 develop simple design rules dielectric 
spiral allow optimization q  project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
