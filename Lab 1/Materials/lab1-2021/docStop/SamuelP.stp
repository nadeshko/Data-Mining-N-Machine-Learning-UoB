third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title:graphics-based 
distance measurement maps student name:peter 
samuel supervisor:ms project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
increasing use hand-held computing 
systems user-friendly walk planning 
system now possibility capabilities 
such route planning distance measurement 
system should capable using down-loadable 
maps any scale route distances easily 
determined simple graphics pen-based 
scanning system displayed clearly expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 project involve developing system able 
use scanning device such graphics light 
pen measure distance along road os map 
system must take into account map scale 
must adjustable probably software envisaged 
system run palm top device able use down 
loaded maps internet  http://www.multimap.com 
full front end interface should provided 
enabling map scale input length road 
scanned distance displayed different 
units miles kilometres fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  simple distance route 
distance measuring system using graphics 
pen pda  use downloaded maps  possible 
because hardware limitations development 
pic-based system simple distance measuring 
device using real os maps enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 full route planning system involving 
check points associated gui  communicating 
other walkers current position time 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm 
uniqueness project placing tick adjacent
