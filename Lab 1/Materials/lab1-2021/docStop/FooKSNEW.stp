mjl project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
home commercial environments often 
inconvenient large length wire between 
audio equipment speakers project build 
stereo wireless speaker system transmitter 
attached audio equipment receiver attached 
speakers expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  expected wireless system demonstrated 
working showing good high quality sound 
over stereo connection fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  test either just receive 
section just transmit section  make mono 
only system enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  once basic system demonstrated 
suggest improvements order improve 
quality audio output  consider other 
types communication including bluetooth 
wifi  consider complex antenna design 
higher gain suggest what requirements 
may  look into optimization low cost production 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material

background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
radar systems around large number years 
project uses many well known principles 
use past however modern components used 
make compact inexpensive system basic 
imaging objects local area expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 outcome basic system consisting antenna 
duplexer transmit receive amplifiers 
possibly oscillator mixer system tested 
under laboratory conditions determine 
operational capabilities full design 
considerations radar documented report 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 test either just receive section just 
transmit section enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  provide a/d 
d/a converters apply basic signals  interface 
computer a/d converter  rotate antenna 
form image  apply signal processing produce
