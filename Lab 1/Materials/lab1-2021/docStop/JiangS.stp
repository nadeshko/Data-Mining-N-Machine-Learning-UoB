third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title comparative 
study sepic converter student name shuai 
jiang supervisor svmollov project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
sepic advanced dc/dc converter increasingly 
used single-stage power factor correction 
circuits expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  compare performance three types 
sepic converter po=200w vo=15v vin=50v 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 design sepic converter conventional 
circuit transformer isolated circuit 
integrated magnetics circuit  design 
magnetic components three types enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 build test conventional sepic converter 
2.2  build test transformer isolated 
sepic converter 2.1  build test integrated 
magnetics sepic converter first project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm 
uniqueness project placing tick adjacent
