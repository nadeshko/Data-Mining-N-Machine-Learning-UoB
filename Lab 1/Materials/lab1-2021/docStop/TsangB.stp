third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title low temperature 
resistance ablestick microwave adhesive 
film microwave frequencies student 
name benjamin tsang supervisor fh project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist manufacturers 
usually provide data sheets products 
do always cover eventualities such operation 
cryogenic temperatures aim project 
find resistance above commercially 
available material function temperature 
resistance very low simple ohm-meter 
utterly inappropriate even dc resistance 
found measuring q resonator design resonator 
differ related project involving different 
material expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  1 design curves giving surface 
resistance material function frequency 
temperature 2 supporting experimental 
data validate curves 3 theoretical principles 
behind measurements calculations including 
skin effect theory transmission lines 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 above only room temperature enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 theory skin effect applied particles 
good conductor matrix poor conductor 
where particles larger than skin depth 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm 
uniqueness project placing tick adjacent 
box other than learning standard theory 
software enough unique material provided 
expected outcomes met
