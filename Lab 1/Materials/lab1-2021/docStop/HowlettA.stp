third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title car entertainment 
controller monitor icecam student name 
howlett supervisor david pycock project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist building car 
audio system goes beyond basics extra 
amplifier(s other components need fitted 
vehicle often these fitted confined 
spaces hidden away practical reasons 
such boot space results some equipment 
getting very hot needing fan cooling 
fans time noise can intrusive low listening 
levels audio systems built competition 
use car battery voltage amplifier temperatures 
also important information user turning 
several amplifiers other components 
off can cause problems normal car radios 
only provide enough current turn one 
two external devices having components 
system switching off same time can cause 
unwanted pops these pops can prevented 
switching each component staggered 
amplifiers turn last off first also useful 
user able control monitor system driver's 
seat expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project design build control 
display unit can monitor temperature 
components car audio system control 
speed fans cool them also measure voltage 
system switch on/off external devices 
staggered manner provide user interface 
can display system data well allow them 
set various system parameters unit split 
into two parts  control box hidden away 
other components audio system small 
display unit can fitted where user wishes 
unit switched off car radio fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  unit can 
display component temperatures vehicle 
voltage control fans  unit can switch 
several external components off delays 
 initial implementation serial interface 
between control box display enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 user defined parameters temperature/fan 
control external device control  display 
maximum/minimum temperatures voltages 
trends reset capability  system can perform 
self test check faulty components project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
