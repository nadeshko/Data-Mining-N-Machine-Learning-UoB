third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title modeling information 
foraging museums using bayesian networks 
student name m tomlinson supervisor 
dr c baber project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
novel theory information retrieval 
assumes humans tend seek information 
satisfy basic information needs just 
searching food satisfy basic sustenance 
needs information foraging theory understanding 
how strategies gathering information 
adapted constant wealth information/knowledge 
environment theory based fact people 
possible modify strategy information 
retrieval order exploit/maximise rate 
information obtained theory also suggests 
successful paths finding information 
can shared other people much same way 
pheromone trials used insects signal 
paths food bayesian belief networks 
graphical representations based probability 
can used model simulate given situation 
taking into account particular context 
networks can devised models can drawn 
provide network interconnecting nodes 
portraying information scent data these 
models can then analysed used maximise 
information obtained i.e museum explorations/visits 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project apply information foraging 
theory context museum visits bayesian 
belief networks need developed model 
information scent i.e gathering/retrieval 
knowledge museum environment model 
then needs analysed optimum route(s 
proposed then tested evaluated against 
observations fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  msbnx microsoft bayesian 
network creator software proves too 
difficult use  decide use alternative 
technique developing model  observational 
data doesn't match model revise enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 novel application information foraging 
theory  model can generalised used other 
situations  bayesian belief networks 
can demonstrated provide viable models 
information foraging project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
