third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title internal subject 
tracking system vr database integration 
student name mark collings supervisor 
rjs project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
without resorting expensive wireless 
optical spatial tracking systems no 
low-cost accessible method registering 
gross location presence individual 
within interior space such vessel building 
using sensed location elicit some relevant 
event virtual representation space 
eg description room occupant storage 
contents location operational instructions 
safety equipment possible display interactive 
virtual artefact  might required museum 
environment etc etc project lay foundation 
ultimately develop network appropriate 
sensors designed conjunction vr help 
enhance familiarisation process complex 
spaces expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project develop demonstrator 
using appropriate sensing technologies 
virtual environment software computing 
facilities sense location individual 
within corridor building use information 
trigger meaningful event within vr reconstruction 
said corridor demonstration based integrated 
sensor-vr system suggest likely real-world 
applications where such system once 
developed could offer significant advantages 
over use conventional map techniques/written 
instructions undirected exploration 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 3d graphical model part corridor section 
eece  basic bench sensor(s illustrate 
detection proof principle  supporting 
program sensor(s hosted pc enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 sensors situ eece corridor  vr program 
portable computer eg palmtop project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm 
uniqueness project placing tick adjacent 
box nb related work performed previously 
context interactive art/multimedia 
exhibits using ir however uniqueness 
particular project relates its integration 
real-time 3d databases possibly hosted 
portable computer
