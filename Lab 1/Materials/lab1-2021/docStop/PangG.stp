third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title speech processing 
using sinusoidal model student name 
george pang supervisor peter jancovic 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist real-world 
applications recorded speech signal 
usually corrupted various types acoustic 
background noise may mixture several 
speakers number single-microphone 
speech processing techniques proposed 
reduce effect noise speech signal project 
study speech-production inspired technique 
processing speech signals specifically 
sinusoidal model speech expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  aim project 
investigate develop program segregation 
speech noise-corrupted speech signals 
using sinusoidal-model based processing 
program should developed c c language 
input program waveform signal wav file 
should processed sinusoidal-model 
algorithm proposed 1 output estimate 
clean speech signal several modifications 
technique should investigated techniques 
developed could evaluated objective 
subjective tests employing processed 
speech signal automatic speech recognition 
system tool provided 1 jensen hansen

speech audio processing vol 9 n 7 october 
2001 fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 program developed matlab environment 
 least several steps method 1 implemented 
one form evaluation performed enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 comparison some other speech processing 
techniques such spectral subtraction 
sine-wave-model should performed  student 
should record small database words/digits 
spoken two three speakers talking simultaneously 
into microphone  modify above algorithm 
segregation individual speech signals 
signal-mixture containing speech several 
speakers project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
