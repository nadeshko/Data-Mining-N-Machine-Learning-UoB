project title simulation platform online 
tutorial computer vision student name 
simon haskell supervisor mo project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist computer vision 
known combination several complex tasks 
signal processing image morphology 
analysis makes its educational goal 
often difficult students grasp consequently 
decomposing task into its sub-constitutes 
building on-tutorial each part sounds 
rational approach help convey complexity 
task expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project design build online 
platform provides online tutorials 
different aspect computer vision include 
image acquisition sampling segmentation 
texture image morphology transform 
camera calibration fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  investigate different 
stages image processing camera calibration 
sampling image segmentation texture 
analysis image morphology  provide simulation 
platform emulates above different stages 
image processing  provide online guidelines 
help each stage enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  quantify performance 
established platform learning perspectives 
 propose recommendations how improve 
design platform results increase learning 
outcomes project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please
