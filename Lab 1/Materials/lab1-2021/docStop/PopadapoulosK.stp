third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title speaker independent 
speech recognition system single isolated 
word student name k papadopoulos supervisor 
prof m russell project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
goal project develop speech processing 
system could used emergency shut-off 
system industrial environment involving 
hazardous equipment thus system must 
able detect recognize stressed speech 
noisy industrial environment project 
two parts first part goal design build 
system able distinguish between normal 
stressed speech noisy enviromnet second 
task design build speaker recognition 
system designed recognize single isolated 
word speaker  independent thus able compensate 
variation occur individuals utterances 
stress tolerant expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design  outcomes project 
should follows 1 understand necessary 
background speech processing 2 implement 
test system distinguish between normal 
stressed speech quiet 3 analyse acoustic 
correlates stress 4 implement test system 
distinguish between normal stressed 
speech noise 5 aim project design simulate 
speaker independent isolated word speech 
recognition system using any programming 
language toolkit fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives 1 mathematical speech processing 
background developed explained accordingly 
2 sequence targets corresponds items 
2 3 above enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  item 4 above  item 5 above project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
