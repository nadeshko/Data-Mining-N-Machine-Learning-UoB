third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title gps position 
signalling maritime sensors student 
name adam robertson supervisor pra project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist oceanographers 
deploy wide range buoys monitoring climatic 
biomass related parameters these usually 
deployed support ships left drift ocean 
currents desirable track position these 
buoys order correlate measured data 
geographical position later recovery 
small gps receivers usually mounted 
top buoys tracking purposes data these 
sensors normally communicated back 
host vessel using low-power radio link 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project design build interface between 
gps receiver radio transmitter data 
stream emanating gps receiver should 
parsed extract latitude longitude positions 
suitable data extrapolation used case 
wave-splash masking gps signals receiver 
data rate should sufficiently decimated 
allow narrow-band modulation scheme 
such psk31 employed fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  implement interface 
between pic microprocessor gps receiver 
 parse received message string extract 
latitude longitude information data 
stream  interpolate predict data case 
wave-wash situation enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  implement psk31 
receiver software perhaps using matlab 
c dsp  consider convolutional coding 
decoding strategies necessary provide 
improved link resilience  implement 
fully functioning system project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
