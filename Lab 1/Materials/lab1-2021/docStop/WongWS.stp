third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title improved recognition 
children speech using frequency wraping 
student name w s wong supervisor prof 
m russell project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
speech recognition many potential applications 
children either replacement conventional 
input/output device key technology 
interactive computer-based language 
tuition systems reading pronunciation 
language learning however speech recognition 
error rates children's speech typically 
much higher than those adults order develop 
computer recognize children's speech 
overcome least two major problems firstly 
children don't pronounce words consistently 
secondly smaller vocal tracts higher 
pitch than adults project focuses second 
problem goal design implement evaluate 
frequency warping techniques compensate 
acoustic effects children's smaller 
vocal tracts expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design  major acoustic 
consequence child's small vocal tract 
frequency spectrum distorted relative 
adult speech goals 1 understand differences 
between adult child speech 2 understand 
basic principles automatic speech recognition 
3 design implement evaluate linear piecewise 
linear frequency warping techniques 
4 measure effect speech recognition 
accuracy using recognizer trained adult 
speech fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 minimal target objectives items 1 2 3 
above enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  design implement evaluate 
non-linear frequency warping techniques 
based dynamic programming minimize 
difference between adult children speech 
spectrum  compare analyse result between 
linear non-linear frequency warping 
solving problem children speech recognition 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet
