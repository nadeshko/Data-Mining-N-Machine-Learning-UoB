third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title basic voice 
scrambler privacy student name aik ng 
supervisor fh project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
voice scrambler divides speech spectrum 
into frequency bands shifts positions 
can implemented using time-domain operations 
alone resulting very efficient algorithm 
uses only about eight multiplications 
per sample processing carried digitally 
transmission over phone line can analog 
scrambler implemented using processor 
such mitsubishi 16c/62 repeats project 
paul neumann about 12 years ago new hardware 
available change character job completely 
recent attempt c.p johnson left much 
undone still lot new material covered 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 demonstration circuit suitable lectures 
open days built experiments carried 
find best combination parameters optimum 
performance further study find effective 
number distinct keys fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  demonstrate proficiency 
microprocessor inputting outputting 
data doing some simple operations such 
frequency shifting  enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  produce hard 
wired stand-alone circuit project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project 
placing tick adjacent box other than 
learning standard theory software enough 
unique material provided expected outcomes 
met
