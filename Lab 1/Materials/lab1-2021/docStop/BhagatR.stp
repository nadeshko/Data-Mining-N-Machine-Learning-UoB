specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist project strategies 
activity computer games playing analysed 
modeled using cpm-goms technique uses 
combination goal decomposition task 
timing critical path analysis describe 
parallel task activity expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  aim project 
produce testable predictive models 
human performance dynamic activity 
order explore acquisition development 
skills fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 game playing too complex model then necessary 
concentrate either simpler games subsets 
activity  decision making involved gaming 
too complex then project focus only physical 
actions enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  like investigate multiplayer 
online gaming explore predictive models 
team performance  like model effects 
different interaction devices gaming 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
