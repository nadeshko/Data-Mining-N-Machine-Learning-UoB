third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title networking 
network security traffic based sampling 
student name mlm yiu supervisor ajg project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist general view 
networking its flaws ways combat security 
problems growing popularity wireless 
networking means technology suspect 
attacks coverage current technologies 
further investigation into area provides 
background project focus project network 
security area network security included 
network sampling methods allows traffic 
monitoring along random based sampling 
files sent across lan further observations 
applying monitoring process can applied 
internet expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project design network sampling 
tool monitors network traffic should 
monitor inbound outbound traffic directly 
observing port activity include basic 
monitoring ip protocols such tcp udp 
traffic background theory knowledge 
based networking researched into such 
broadband communication technologies 
applications such security tools concerning 
security fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  basic understanding sampling 
methods allow demonstration mathematical 
theory practical programming examples 
identified allow simpler system using 
purely text files incoming source sampling 
 having identified basic sampling elements 
say one character blocks elements can 
then sample such simple message images 
possibly sound enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  peer 2 peer program 
detection  detection peer peer traffic 
activity network traffic  detection 
messaging programs such msn icq  identification 
files being sent sampled network traffic 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
