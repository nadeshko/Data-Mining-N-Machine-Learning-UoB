russell project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
part eu framework 5 project called pf_star 
need measure how well adults can recognize 
children's speech compared adult's 
speech order conduct experiment software 
needed organize large corpus speech 
into database test utterances corrupt 
test utterances example adding noise 
restricting bandwidth present utterances 
prescribed way subjects record responses 
these responses might free text multiple 
choice responses must then compared 
correct responses calculate error rate 
goal project design write software design 
should take into account views researchers 
use software comments pilot subjects 
software must reliable easy use both 
subject experimenter documented expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 main output project suite software conduct 
experiment described above plus evidence 
proper test procedures plus evidence 
software acceptable ergonomic human 
factors perspective both subjects experimenters 
plus documentation fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  produce good software 
design justification  develop prototype 
system enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  addition producing software 
initial experiments conducted using 
software results reported final bench 
inspection final report  access speech 
data over internet project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
