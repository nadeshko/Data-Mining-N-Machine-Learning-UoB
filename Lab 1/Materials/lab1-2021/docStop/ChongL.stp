third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title simple smart 
textiles student name l chong supervisor 
dr c baber project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
electronic devices become smaller lighter 
hence portable over recent years however 
still bulky awkward making them unsuitable 
tool help modern day life pdas instance 
excessively delicate heavy require 
extra storage compartment wearable 
devices making way into consumer market 
still obtrusive always aethestically 
pleasing methods devised weave components 
into conductive fabric devices integrated 
directly into clothing can potentially 
invisible naked eye computerized clothing 
make computers devices portable without 
having strap electronics our bodies 
fill our pockets gadgets these clothes 
necessarily designed replace your pc 
able perform some same functions add 
technology person environment need 
develop novel means communicating between 
devices could done using wireless technologies 
could project involve incorporating 
means communication into clothing expected 
outcomes project start research into 
materials suitable use fabrics wearable 
computer system results research used 
design wearable application actual 
application decided yet focusing aspects 
system result most natural intuitive 
unobtrusive human-computer interface 
hci medical applications considered 
incorporate into computerised clothing 
examples include respiration rate pressure 
temperature sensors pulse rate fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  integration 
simple working application e.g wiring 
circuit comprising only battery bulb 
switch woven into fabric itself  production 
wearable device conventional components 
located natural hci does attempt use 
fabric itself any part circuit enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 device use fabric something than wiring 
loom switch visual feedback user could 
implemented weaving fibre optics into 
fabric alternatively leds lcd could 
used  wireless technology such infrared 
bluetooth can incorporated extension 
application control external devices 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
