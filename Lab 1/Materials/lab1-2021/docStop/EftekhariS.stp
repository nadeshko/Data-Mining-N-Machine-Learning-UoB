project title:colour quantisation 
student name s eftekhari supervisor:ms 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist full 
colour representation typically 24 
bits rgb display normally visually similar 
results can obtained displaying data 
resolution 8bits 256 distinct colours 
obtained quantising clustering colour 
space using clustering algorithms expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 project aimed producing image processing 
system able evaluate different colour 
quantisation systems envisaged system 
use java based jimage toolkit although 
java advanced imaging jai api can also 
used fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 basic gui front end manipulating colour 
images  implmentation simple clustering 
algorithm  evaluation clustering algorithm 
natural colour images enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  investigation 
advanced clustering algorithms  investigation 
neural network-based approaches  investigation 
invariance simple images processing 
algorithms quantised colour images 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
