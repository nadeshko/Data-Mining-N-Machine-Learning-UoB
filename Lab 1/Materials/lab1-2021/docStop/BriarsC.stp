third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title chroma-key 
tool student name christopher david 
briars supervisor peter jancovic project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist chroma-key 
technique used film television industry 
artificially place background scene 
needed behind person person filmed front 
specific background-colour usually 
green blue then background colour can 
replaced arbitrary scene digital manipulation 
video frames expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design  aim project develop 
such chroma-key tool creating noisy 
audio-visual speech recognition database 
cuave database stored mpeg2 format green 
background program should take two mpeg2 
files input  one being original file a-v 
database one being background output 
program should encoded mpeg noisy file 
sequence noisy static images each frame-time 
program may consider software such javamedia 
libmpeg3 may build some parts source-code 
already available department fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  use some 
software tool decode mpeg2 stream into 
sequence static images  develop tool 
replacing green-background static 
images various images c c  problems develop 
chroma-key tool matlab enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 separate audio stream mpeg2 files store 
separate files  encode noisy image frames 
back mpeg2 format  since hard estimate 
progress project additionally development 
some lip-localization/tracking techniques 
may considered project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
