mj russell project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
goal project design spoken language 
interface robot toy children interface 
must recognize different natural language 
commands child might give analyse them 
determine child's intent then send correct 
command sony aibo robot enable carry 
instruction problem example child can 
say turn right numerous ways commands 
presented system text task system interpret 
command correctly transcripts children 
talking aibo wizard-of-oz experiments 
provided training material system additional 
transcripts withheld until end project 
used unseen test set expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  1 understanding 
basic issues natural language nl processing 
spoken language processing 2 understanding 
wizard-of-oz methodology collecting 
spontaneous speech 3 analysis ways child 
might talk robot dog sony aibo based existing 
recordings made wizard oz experiments 
pf_star project 4 design implement evaluate 
text-based system controlling aibo 
using children's natural language fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  items 
1 2 3 above plus design implement text-based 
system controlling aibo using children's 
natural language commands enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 implement working system enables aibo 
controlled over wireless lan using natural 
language text commands project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project
