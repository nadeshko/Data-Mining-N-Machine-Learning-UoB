third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title wavelength 
division multiplexing architecture 
student name liew hai ling supervisor 
dr h ghafouri-shiraz project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
general single-hop photonic networks 
suffer speed mismatch between optical 
electronic components because optical 
fiber bandwidth close 75 tb/s while current 
electronics processing limited few 
gb/s basic concept wavelength division 
multiplexing wdm technology ability 
transmit data simultaneously multiple 
wavelengths using single fiber wdm networks 
provide practical solution op-electronic 
speed mismatch problem expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  project 
design wdm network architecture required 
several control channels overcome electronic 
processing bottleneck fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  describes network 
architecture model  numerical graphs 
results enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  design wdm network architecture 
required several control channels overcome 
electronic processing bottleneck  presents 
performance measures under receiver 
collision analysis project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
