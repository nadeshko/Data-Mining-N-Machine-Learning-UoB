 1 basic system involve combining different 
types files 2 ability cut pace sounds 
together 3 user defined interface vb 
based 4 uml design 5 understanding midi 
sound elements vb fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  good user requirements analysis 
 good approach project life cycle using
