third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title simulation 
controlled three phase rectifiers aircraft 
applications student name e w f lau supervisor 
dr j forsyth project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
mechanical hydraulic actuation devices 
aircraft replaced electric systems 
increasing amount non-linear rectifier 
load being placed power distribution 
system therefore important devise develop 
high performance controlled rectifiers 
understand characteristics expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 project use saber simulation system 
evaluate compare number phase controlled 
rectifier configurations start basic 
six-pulse circuit then progress examine 
twelve pulse systems regenerative operation 
distribution system interaction fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  six-pulse 
rectifier phase control implemented 
saber  full evaluation simulation performance 
comparison theoretical expectations 
 literature review high pulse number 
controlled rectifiers enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 extension consider 12-pulse 18-pulse 
24-pulse systems full evaluation performance 
comparison  operation system regenerative 
mode project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
