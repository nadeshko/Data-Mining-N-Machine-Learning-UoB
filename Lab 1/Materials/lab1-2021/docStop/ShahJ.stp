third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title analysis characteristics 
optically controlled microstrip load 
student name jeet shah supervisor dr 
h ghafouri shiraz project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
direct optical control microwave devices 
area interest over last few years technique 
offers high isolation between controlling 
optical source controlled microwave 
device optical control passive microwave 
devices semiconducting substrate based 
fact photons energies greater than semiconductor 
band gap incident surface electron-hole 
pairs created due carrier diffusion 
light absorption spread into substrate 
give inhomogeneous carrier distribution 
illuminated substrate expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  aim project 
analyse optical control microstrip 
load stub microstrip line fabricated 
high resistivity silicon substrate 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 become familiar ads similar microwave 
design software  understand concepts 
microstrip transmission lines semiconductors 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  advantages applications 
microstrip transmission line  carry 
simulations microstrip line load different 
substrate project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing
