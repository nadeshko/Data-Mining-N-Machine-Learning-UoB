Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title:
                                RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS

Student Name:
                           OLUWABUNMI EDWIN

Supervisor:
                        MSH



Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)

A system that takes recommendations about movies and makes predictions on what movies the user will like to see.


Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 

The aim of the project is to design, implement and evaluate a recommender system for movies. The expected outcome will be a system that takes the users' preference for movies, matches them with other user profiles and their recommendations and from that, makes recommendations to the current user. It will allow people to rate movies and add new movies to the system's database. It will also allow for user privacy by providing a log-on screen and allowing the user to edit their profile.


Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)

* To match preferences for movies and user profile against the database of profiles and recommendations.
* Based on match, movie recommendations will be made.
* Provide a basic user interface for preferences.


Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)

* Interface to rate movies.
* Interface to add new movies.
* Interface to indicate a user profile. 
* Extension of the system, e.g.  To recommend books or other items.


Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
