Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: Detector of Unauthorized Wireless Communications in Examination Rooms


Student Name: W Agricole


Supervisor: CCC




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
The proliferation of Bluetooth and ad hoc WLAN (802.11b) devices opens the possibility of sophisticated methods of cheating during University examinations. This project will design, built and test a detector of unauthorized transmissions in rooms where examinations are being held. The detector will be a single-band device operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, which will have three output indicators for no transmission, active WLAN transmission and active Bluetooth transmission, respectively.

Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
The aim of this project is to design a hand-held, battery-powered detector capable of producing a binary detection of transmissions, has a signal strength indicator, and ideally can identify the type of transmission (e.g. Bluetooth, IEEE802.11b, etc.). The detector will comprise two parts, a radio frequency down-converter and an I.F. or baseband decision circuit of varied sophistication and complexity. The battery lifetime of the device must be at least 3 hours.

Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Study the WiFi and Bluetooth standards
* Design and build the r.f. sub-system out of off-the-shelf components
* Design and build a basic signal strength detector

Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* Being able to identify the type of transmission
* Implement an intelligent/flexible decision circuit/sub-system
* Consider the extension to multi-band detection to include mobile phones, etc.

Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
