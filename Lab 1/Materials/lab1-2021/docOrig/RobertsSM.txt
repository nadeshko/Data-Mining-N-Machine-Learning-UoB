Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title:
                                Home control from Pocket PC

Student Name:
                           Steven M Roberts

Supervisor:
                        MSh



Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)

Control of home entertainment and consumer devices from handheld computer with wireless (WiFi) connection


Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 

The aim of the project is to design, implement and evaluate a home control system using wireless Pocket PC computers as handheld controllers. The system should enable a person with little or no training to operate devices such as lights or a music centre. 


Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)

* Interface and interaction design for a home controller for multiple devices, running on a Pocket PC machine
* Ability to control a mains on/off device such as a light
* Evaluation of interface and interactivity

Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)

* Well-designed interface and interaction, conforming to Pocket PC standards where appropriate.
* Ability to control multiple devices
* Ability to pre-set a sequence of control operations
* Ability to control a more complex device such as a PC-based music or video system.
* Evaluation with home users of usability, usefulness and desirability.


Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
