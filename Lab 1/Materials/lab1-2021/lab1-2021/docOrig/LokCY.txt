Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title:   Monitoring High-Bandwidth Encrypted Data Streams
	

Student Name:   Choon Yik Lok


Supervisor:   SMC




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)

A recent project has demonstrated that speech recognition in hardware is feasible, which allows automatic electronic eavesdropping providing communication channels are not encrypted. Thus there is a demand for high-speed encryption and decryption. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been demonstrated to be a suitable technology both for implementing switching fabrics in high-bandwidth networks and also cryptographic algorithms. For maximum efficiency, these  functions should be combined, thus making use of the massive on-chip bandwidth offered by modern FPGAs. 
 

Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 

The aim of this project is to design, implement and evaluate an FPGA-based stream processor capable of extracting selected packets from an incoming data stream, and decrypting them. A range of cryptographic algorithms targeting the Xilinx Virtex-E series of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) should be evaluated. This range should include Helix, a recently-announced encryption/authentication algorithm from Counterpane Internet Security. The evaluation should consider the performance of the FPGA-based system in relation to software implementations, and also the efficiency with which the algorithms can be mapped into hardware. 
 

Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.) 

* To demonstrate, using the RC1000 coprocessors available, encryption and decryption using a simple symmetric block cipher such as TEA or RC5.
* To demonstrate selective extraction of data packets from a continuous data stream using a switching fabric implemented on an RC1000
* To design, implement and test a program to synthesize a packet-based data stream and allowing the user to selectively insert a payload
 

Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.) 

* To use two RC1000 coprocessors to demonstrate selective encryption and decryption of data carried over a high-bandwidth packet-based network
* To design, construct and test an adapter allowing two RC1000 coprocessors to be connected together via their general-purpose I/O headers
* To develop a protocol for inter-processor communication over this link, with the goal of maximizing the achievable bandwidth 
 

Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
