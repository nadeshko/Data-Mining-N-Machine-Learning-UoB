Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title:   GPS Position Signalling from Maritime Sensors


Student Name:   Adam Robertson


Supervisor:   PRA




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
Oceanographers deploy a wide range of buoys for monitoring climatic and biomass related parameters.   These are usually deployed from support ships and left to drift in the ocean currents.   It is desirable to track the position of these buoys in order to correlate the measured data with the geographical position or for later recovery.   Small GPS receivers are usually mounted on the top of the buoys for tracking purposes.   The data from these sensors is normally communicated back to the host vessel using a low-power radio link.

Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
The aim of this project is to design and build an interface between a GPS receiver and a radio transmitter.   The data stream emanating from the GPS receiver should be parsed to extract the latitude and longitude positions and suitable data extrapolation be used for the case of wave-splash masking the GPS signals from the receiver.   The data rate should be sufficiently decimated to allow a narrow-band modulation scheme (such as PSK31) to be employed.

Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* To implement the interface between a PIC microprocessor and a GPS receiver.
* To parse the received message string and extract latitude and longitude information from the data stream.
* To interpolate and predict the data for the case of a wave-wash situation.

Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* To implement a PSK31 receiver in software (perhaps using MATLAB, C or a DSP).
* To consider the convolutional coding and decoding strategies necessary to provide improved link resilience.
* To implement a fully functioning system.

Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
