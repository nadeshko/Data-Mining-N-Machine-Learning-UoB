Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: Class D active subwoofer


Student Name: Marcel Kijak


Supervisor: SVMollov




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
A subwoofer design targeting time-linear performance and minimum THD yet best transient response.



Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
To design the H-bridge, identify sensor, design feedback
200W rms output; THD<%; 20-200Hz +/-3dB



Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Design H-bridge and gate drivers.

* Design active feedback

* Full schematic (inclusive of auxiliary circuits)


Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* Build and test H-bridge: 2.2

* Build and test control loop:  2.1

* Build and test entire system to full power: first


Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
