Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: Tactile Discrimination of Computer Generated Braille Characters using a Glove-Mounted Tactile-feedback Transducer


Student Name: SUJAN KUPUSAMY


Supervisor: Prof .BOB STONE




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
The user wears the glove which has a sensor on the fingertip and moves his hand on a pad or in the air. The virtual environment software brings forth the movement into the environment.
When the user touches the Braille characters in the virtual environment, he/she could feel the senses or in the other words the sensor creates the touch feedback of the Braille characters in the glove.  

Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
The aim of this project is to design a virtual environment for the blind to learn Braille characters and a lot more. They could be able to sense the textures of the characters and learn using a computer.




Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Using I-Feel mouse instead of the glove for the tactile feedback.

* Generate several shapes replacing Braille characters.

* Use other Virtual Reality software.

Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* Use many sensors on the fingers and thumb.

* Use sound to give feedback to the user.

* Use many environments as a teaching tool.

Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
