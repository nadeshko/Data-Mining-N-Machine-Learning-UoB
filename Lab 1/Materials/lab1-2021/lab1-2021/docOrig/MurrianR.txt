Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title:   HF Transmitter and Receiver for Small Antennas


Student Name:   Richard Murrian


Supervisor:   PRA




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
Oceanographers deploy a wide range of buoys for monitoring climatic and biomass related parameters.   These may be connected via low-Earth orbit satellites (at extreme expense) or via a VHF radio link (typically limited to about 10 km).   An alternative when using clusters of buoys in open ocean environments is to use HF surface-wave propagation channels.   However, for this approach to be feasible, there is a need for a low-cost, power-efficient transmitter-receiver capable of signaling at rates approaching 100 k bits per second whilst driving electrically short antennas.

Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
The aim of this project is to design and build a power-efficient receiver based on the Tayloe mixer.   An analysis of the system performance should be carried out for a device capable of operating at a single frequency in the 15 - 30 MHz band.   Thus a set of design guidelines will be produced showing a suitable compromise between power consumption, frequency stability, strong-signal performance and noise-limited performance.

Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.) 
* To build and test a Tayloe detector mixer using fast bus switches and driving the device from standard laboratory signal sources.
* To build and test a receiver, pre-mixer filter optimized for use with an electrically small antenna.
* To build and test an RF preamplifier with good strong-signal performance.

Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.) 
* To investigate the capabilities of the analog Devices Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) integrated circuits for use as the local-oscillator source.
* To consider the performance benefits resulting from spur-reduction in the output of the DDS resulting from the use of narrow-band filters in the local-oscillator signal path.
* To design and build a matching transmitter capable of driving 5W into an electrically-short antenna.

Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
