Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: A Dual-Band Chebyshev Impedance Transformer 


Student Name: Usamah Yaseen


Supervisor: Dr H Ghafour-Shiraz




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)

Impedance matching is a classical topic in microwave engineering which arises in a wide variety of microwave system. In many cases of practical interest, including dual-band mobile telephony, impedance matching over two separated bands is required. 




Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 

The aim of this project is therefore to design a dual-band impedance transformer based on Chebyshev synthesis of the single-band transformer.




Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)

Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* The design of a dual-band impedance transformer based on Chebyshev synthesis of the single-band transformer.

Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
