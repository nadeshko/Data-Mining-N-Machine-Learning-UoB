M-sequence test generator

1. The aim: To develop M-sequences generator as a stand along instrument, using hard universal logic IC 
2. Specification: Number of sequences - three (M=8191, m=13; M=65535, m=16; M=524287, m=19); clock frequency >20MHz: all input -output BNC connectors at the front panel, Power- 5V dc, to change the sequence a mechanical switch on the front panel should be used. 'Zero' combination protection logic should be included.
3. Main activities1: 	Literature review in spread spectrum and CDMA technology
Choice of M-sequences
Modelling these sequences
Block diagram of the generator development
Integrated circuits selection
Electrical circuits development
Printed board development
Instrument assembling and testing

4. Extra work2;	Theoretical analysis of   FPGA and microprocessors usage for the M-sequence generator development.
