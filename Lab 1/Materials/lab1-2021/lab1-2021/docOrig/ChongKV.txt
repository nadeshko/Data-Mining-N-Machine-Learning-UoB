Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: DC-DC Converter for Electric Vehicles


Student Name: K V Chong


Supervisor: Dr A J Forsyth




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
The project is concerned with the development of a DC-DC converter to interface a low voltage fuel cell to the high voltage storage battery or supercap and the traction drive system in a future electric vehicle.


Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
A detailed design study will be completed to identify the most appropriate circuit and devices for a 5-10 kW DC-DC converter. The converter is to be designed, constructed and tested to evaluate its performance. High efficiency and small size are essential.

Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Analysis and outline design of two alternative DC-DC converters
* Detailed design of one circuit
* Circuit simulation completed to check design


Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* Construction of full evaluation of prototype
* Design + implementation of control loop
* Consideration of issues surrounding the interface with super capacitors instead of a battery.


Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
