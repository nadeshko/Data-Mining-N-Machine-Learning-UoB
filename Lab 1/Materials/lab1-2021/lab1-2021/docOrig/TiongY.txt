Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: A 30MHz inverter


Student Name: Yee Tiong


Supervisor: SVMollov




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
MOSFETs are very difficult to switch around and beyond 10MHz. Industrial processes require sine waveforms of 27MHz and more.
The suggested inverter exploits and interesting idea based on 'harmonic multiplication and cancellation'.



Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
Build and test an inverter at 30MHz.
Get MOSFETs to switch at 10MHz.
Input voltage 50-300V



Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Design inverter inclusive of inductive components.

* Design gate drivers and signal generator

* Full schematic (inclusive of auxiliary citcuits)


Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* Build and test gate driver    2.2

* Build and test an invert pole at 50V and 10MHz    2.1

* Build and test inverter at 50-300V and 30MHz:   first


Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
