Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title:  Coupling of microstrip double spirals as a function of direction


Student Name: Chin Loong LIM


Supervisor:  FH




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)

Analogous to the radiation pattern of an antenna, the near-field coupling coefficient of a double-spiral microstrip resonator is expected to vary with direction.  This is to be studied using an electromagnetic simulator.




Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 

1. Design curves of coupling coefficient as a function of direction and distance, with supporting data from simulations.
2. A qualitative explanation of the results based on physical arguments.
3. A discussion on electric and magnetic coupling, and the design of probes to differentiate between them. 


Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)

* No. 1 above.


Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)

* Recommendations on how to design filter banks for minimum coupling between filters.



Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.

Other than learning standard theory and software, there is enough unique material provided the expected outcomes are met.
