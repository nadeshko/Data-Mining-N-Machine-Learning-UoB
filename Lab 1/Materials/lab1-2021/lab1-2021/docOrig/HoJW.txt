Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: Dielectric Resonators in the Hakki-Coleman configuration


Student Name: Ms J W Ho 


Supervisor: Dr P Smith




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
A Dielectric Resonator (DR) is simply a cylindrical piece of ceramic that acts as a resonant structure when its length, or diameter, become approximately equal to a multiple of a 1/2 wavelength. Dielectric Resonators are widely used in Basestation receivers as the filter elements in mobile phone systems.  This project will involve the use of the software package Matlab to model a Dielectric Resonator when it has metal plates on the top and bottom faces (Hakki-Coleman configuration).  This project will involve a significant amount of Matlab modelling as well as a fair amount of mathematical derivation.



Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
The aim of this project is to: 
* Predict the frequency of the TE011 mode when a DR is in the Hakki Coleman configuration, along with the other TM and hybrid modes.
* Determine the permittivity of actual samples. 
* Predict the Q of the hakki coleman structure and compare this to actual measurements (taking into account conductor and dielectric loss). 
* Finally the software will be used to calculate the Tan d of actual ceramic samples


Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Predict the frequency of the TE011 mode when a DR is in the Hakki Coleman configuration

* Determine the permittivity of actual samples



Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* Calculate the Q of the TM and hybrid modes taking into account conductor and dielectric losses

* 



Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
