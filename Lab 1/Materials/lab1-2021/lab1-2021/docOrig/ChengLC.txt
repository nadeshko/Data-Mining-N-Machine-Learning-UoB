Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: Finite difference Calculation for Ferroelectric Materials


Student Name: L C Cheng


Supervisor: MJL




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)

The finite difference method is well know for linear materials, however ferroelectrics have a permittivity which is dependant upon the applied voltage. This has consequences on the impedance of a transmission line where the ferroelectric is used as the insulating materials.




Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 

The outcome of the project will be a finite difference calculation for ferroelectric materials. The calculation will show the voltage at any point in the cross section of a microstrip transmission line given the relationship between the permittivity and voltage of the ferroelectric material.



Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Constant permittivity calculation of electric field

* Calculation of impedance of microstrip with constant permittivity.


Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)

* Calculation of electric field of a ferroelectric microstrip

* Calculation of the impedance of a ferroelectric microstrip

* Calculation of other types of transmission lines

* Investigation of devices based on the calculations


Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
