Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: Comparative study of Sepic converter


Student Name: Shuai Jiang


Supervisor: SVMollov




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
SEPIC is an advanced DC/DC converter increasingly used in single-stage power factor correction circuits.



Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
Compare the performance of three types of SEPIC converter
Po=200W Vo=15V Vin=50V


Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Design SEPIC converter: conventional circuit, transformer isolated circuit and integrated magnetics circuit

* Design of magnetic components for the three types

Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* Build and test conventional SEPIC converter:   2.2

* Build and test transformer isolated SEPIC converter:  2.1

* Build and test integrated magnetics SEPIC converter: first


Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
