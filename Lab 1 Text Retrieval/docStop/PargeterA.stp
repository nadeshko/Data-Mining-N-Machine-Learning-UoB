third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title microprocessor 
based fault detection diagnosis student 
name pargeter supervisor clive roberts 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist changing 
maintenance strategy reactive proactive 
beneficial means detect diagnose incipient 
faults systems usually carried collecting 
data systems question using set transducers 
show dynamic operation characteristics 
geographically distributed systems 
data often collected using fieldbus 
type network nodes order reduce bandwidth 
data being transmitted hence overall 
cost system interest carryout site fault 
detection diagnosis node level using 
microprocessor thus creating intelligent 
asset capable predict its own maintenance 
requirements expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design  aim project interface 
mitsubishi m16c microprocessor board 
university's existing worldfip fieldbus 
node system set system transducer data 
provided m16c should able reduce transducer 
data intelligent manner produce indication 
fault detection require  development 
appropriate hardware m16c interface 
addition memory requirements  undertaking 
academic research fault detection diagnosis 
theory both fields control engineering 
soft computing  writing software algorithms 
fault detection exceptional project 
also consider issues relating fault 
diagnosis well fault detection fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  communication 
transducer data existing worldfip node 
mitsubishi m16c board  demonstration 
simple thresholding techniques fault 
detection  understanding complex methods 
might applied enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  development 
complex fault detection diagnosis e.g 
fft control theory methods demonstrated 
pc  implementation toolbox using mitsubishi 
board data collected through worldfip 
node  clear understanding appropriateness 
methods selected identification shortcomings 
appropriate practical implementation 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
