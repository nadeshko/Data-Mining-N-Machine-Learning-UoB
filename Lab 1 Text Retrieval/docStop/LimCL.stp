third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title coupling microstrip 
double spirals function direction student 
name chin loong lim supervisor fh project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist analogous 
radiation pattern antenna near-field 
coupling coefficient double-spiral 
microstrip resonator expected vary 
direction studied using electromagnetic 
simulator expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design  1 design curves 
coupling coefficient function direction 
distance supporting data simulations 
2 qualitative explanation results based 
physical arguments 3 discussion electric 
magnetic coupling design probes differentiate 
between them fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  no 1 above enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  recommendations 
how design filter banks minimum coupling 
between filters project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project 
placing tick adjacent box other than 
learning standard theory software enough 
unique material provided expected outcomes
