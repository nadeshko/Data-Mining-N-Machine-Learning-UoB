third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title dc-dc converter 
electric vehicles student name k v chong 
supervisor dr j forsyth project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
project concerned development dc-dc 
converter interface low voltage fuel 
cell high voltage storage battery supercap 
traction drive system future electric 
vehicle expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  detailed design study completed 
identify most appropriate circuit devices 
5-10 kw dc-dc converter converter designed 
constructed tested evaluate its performance 
high efficiency small size essential 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 analysis outline design two alternative 
dc-dc converters  detailed design one 
circuit  circuit simulation completed 
check design enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  construction full evaluation 
prototype  design  implementation control 
loop  consideration issues surrounding 
interface super capacitors instead 
battery project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
