third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title mm-wave antenna 
array beamforming network student name 
cong li supervisor pg project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
low cost high quality antenna arrays 
needed mm-wave automotive communication 
systems conventional methods producing 
such antennas tend expensive lead structures 
compatible vehicle mounting project 
aims develop technique low cost production 
antennas beamformer networks vehicles 
operating cept designated band 63-64 
ghz expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project design build test 
low frequency demonstrator switched 
beam antenna system 63-64 ghz band suitable 
frequency demonstrate principle operation 
21-21.3 ghz input ports should waveguide 
compatibility intended 63-64 ghz operation 
coaxial connectors expensive impractical 
band fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 simulation elements system using commercial 
em simulator including transmission 
line coupler sections enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  demonstrate 
beam switching 21 ghz version  scale design 
full 63-64 ghz band fully simulate  build 
test 63 ghz version demonstrate beam 
switching 63 ghz version project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project
