third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title development 
simplified 3d test users spatial navigation 
capabilities within virtual environments 
student name jack hicks 8098 supervisor 
rjs project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
spatial awareness general term applied 
knowledge individual holds about 3d 
environment exists extent one's spatial 
knowledge can influenced task one perform 
historically found example goal-directed 
navigation promotes better spatial 
awareness subsequent recall than passive 
exploration environment also known 
different individuals exhibit different 
abilities mental representation exploitation 
spatial features once one moves real 
world synthetic virtual environments 
typically delivered via low-resolution 
low field-of-view head-mounted desktop 
projection displays these abilities 
demonstrated marked effect expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project develop early demonstrator 
based simple virtual environment used 
test spatial awareness characteristics 
range subjects test environment take 
form simple three-dimensional room-like 
environment endowed objects various 
shapes sizes various locations orientations 
some objects shaded using simple colours 
complex textures even alphanumeric 
items spatial recall performance subjects 
using simple test environment then compared 
performance complex virtual environment

sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 development limited 3d test environment 
 reduction number independent dependent 
variables chosen experimental study 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  include use known psychometric 
tests eg shephard  metzler 3d mental rotation 
test possibly its recently-converted 
3d graphics form plus embedded figures 
test  test program portable computer 
eg palmtop project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing 
tick adjacent box uniqueness project 
lies development use 3d test environment 
its application games engine vr world
