third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title finite state 
control voltage conditioning storage 
system student name siang lim supervisor 
svmollov project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
voltage aircraft systems can vary lot 
mainly due load switching problem exacerbated 
all-electric aircraft where number 
pulsed constant power loads very much 
increased voltage conditioner should 
counteract resulting large voltage 
excursions main voltage distribution 
bus also provide fast energy transfer 
pulsed power loads tactical aircraft 
system specs cater 1kw load vdc=270v 
should cover transients 10ms storage 
current 20a expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design  design power stage 
control circuits simulate entire system 
build operate system test full power 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 calculate passive components design 
magnetic component  design control circuit 
 full schematic code listing applicable 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  full system simulation 2.2 
 build operate system 2.1  test full load 
specification first project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
