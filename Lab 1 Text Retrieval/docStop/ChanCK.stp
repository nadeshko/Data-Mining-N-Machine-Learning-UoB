third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title reconfigurable 
processors low-cost embedded systems 
student name chi kar chan supervisor 
smc project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
due rapid improvements being made silicon 
process technologies integrated circuit 
densities performance still increasing 
according moore's law means embedded 
system designers must deal problem ever-shorter 
product lifecycles rapid obsolescence 
off-the-shelf components one possible 
solution problem implement processors 
programmable logic then process technologies 
improve designers can immediately benefit 
greater performance provided silicon 
without having modify original designs 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project design implement evaluate 
synthesizable vhdl model microchip 
pic microcontroller targeting latest 
spartan-3 fpgas xilinx model should 
able directly execute simulation code 
produced microchip assembler mpasm 
based source code containing subset 
pic12/16-series instruction set selection 
supported subset should based analysis 
typical usage model should synthesized 
efficiently mapped spartan-3 architecture 
making use advanced architectural features 
minimize resource requirements maximize 
performance fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  identify those components 
pic microcontrollers can successfully 
implemented using resources provided 
programmable logic devices  develop 
test vhdl model supports instruction 
fetch/decode control flow including 
stack general-purpose components register 
file minimal set arithmetic operations 
configuration registers  evaluate resource 
usage performance microcontroller 
model after synthesis implementation 
using xilinx spartan-3 series fpgas 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  extend architectural features 
supported include available advanced 
features on-chip memory special-function 
registers  build adapter allow direct 
connection fpga-based demonstration 
board containing microcontroller core 
place pic microcontroller  demonstrate 
using common source code behaviour soft 
microcontroller core relation real 
device project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
