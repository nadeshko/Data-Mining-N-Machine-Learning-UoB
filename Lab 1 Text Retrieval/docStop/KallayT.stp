third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title virtual environment 
control/display system supervision 
teleoperation multiple semi-autonomous 
vehicles ai hci issues student name timothy 
kallay supervisor rjs project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
effective display  real-time  objects 
events three dimensional space situational 
awareness purposes gaining considerable 
support number important application 
domains air traffic control deployment 
semi-autonomous air subsea vehicles 
however human factor only given basic 
consideration design proposals such 
systems typically resulting very cluttered 
confusing displays poor interactivity 
project performed conjunction undertaken 
another beng student  chris collins  address 
some ai hci issues associated developing 
synthetic environment display prototype 
ability user move position supervisory 
control 4 simulated vehicles direct 
manual control one subsequent other-vehicle 
flocking expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project design create human-computer 
interface synthetic 3d remote environment 
representation rendered using games 
engine created scratch based those available 
web  main focus chris collins project 
3d interface design based far practical 
existing human factors/ergonomics 
criteria hosted pc interacted using 
off-the-shelf joystick other conventional 
peripherals necessary  keyboard mouse 
etc addition ai program eg games script 
ai implemented endow each 4 simulated 
subsea semi-autonomous vehicles realistic 
motion flocking behaviours human user 
able select one vehicles direct manual 
control remaining vehicles behave accordingly 
maintaining close remote flocking profile 
example depending level mission risk 
specified user high/low fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  minimum basic interface 
ergonomically designed  basic ai implementation 
possibly using 2d display format enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 enhanced user interface  enhanced ai 
behaviours  addition wearable display 
hud-like format project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project
