third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title speech-activated 
multimedia system student name chin 
how chew supervisor peter jancovic project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist speech provides 
natural way human interaction computers 
project speech-activated multimedia 
tool developed such tool receive input 
speech signal microphone process signal 
respond based type input speech expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project develop speech-activated 
multimedia system program should developed 
c c language program should able receive 
input signal microphone spectral-based 
feature representation speech signal 
should implemented program should some 
pattern classification technique e.g 
dynamic programming comparison input 
speech signal stored speech models program 
can assume speech models available can 
loaded file i.e system aimed performing 
only recognition phase training based 
recognized word program should generate 
some response fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  develop program matlab environment 
 input signal microphone captured stored 
file  either these two programmed feature 
parameterization speech signal pattern 
classification method enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 based recognized word program plays 
multimedia file e.g sound wav file  instead 
using dynamic programming use viterbi 
decoder matching stored input speech 
signals i.e hmm-based speech models 
used  incorporation training phase into 
system  i.e before using system recognition 
user pronounce vocabulary speech models 
created project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
