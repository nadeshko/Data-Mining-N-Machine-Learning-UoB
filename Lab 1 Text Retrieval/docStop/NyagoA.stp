third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title digital radio 
mondiale data transmitter student name 
andrew nyago supervisor pra project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist traditionally 
radio broadcast stations using frequencies 
below 30mhz used amplitude modulation 
although permits use simple low-cost 
receivers received audio quality often 
very poor due adverse propagation conditions 
co-channel interference recently international 
consortium proposed replacement amplitude 
modulation system called digital radio 
mondiale drm uses sophisticated digital 
modulation techniques encode mixtures 
audio digital messaging other information 
within highly-resilient digital transmission 
stream expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project design build drm baseband 
transmission modulator transmission 
digital source material audio codec 
sections deemed too complicated consideration 
undergraduate project modulator should 
incorporate frequency reference cells 
amplitude reference cells timing synchronization 
fast access channel fac main service 
channel msc suggested modulator implemented 
pc using standard two-channel sound 
card fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 array ofdm quadrature modulation cells 
set up within computer containing frequency 
reference information inverse fourier 
transformed output sound card  timing 
synchronization cells added basic transmission 
frame generated output  amplitude reference 
cells added basic transmission frame 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  modulator able switch between 
different robustness modes channel 
bandwidths error encoding strategies 
 baseband receiver implemented possibly 
matlab derive errors sound card sampling 
rate frequency setting errors receiver 
 receiver adapted decode digital data 
transmitted project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing
