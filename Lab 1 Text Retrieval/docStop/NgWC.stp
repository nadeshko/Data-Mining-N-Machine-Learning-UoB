third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title lip localization 
audio-visual speech recognition student 
name ng wen chun supervisor peter jancovic 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist lip 
movement can provide information can 
used improve performance speech recognition 
system order use lip information audio-visual 
speech recognition system  first lip 
region needs localized project involve 
localization lips using audio-visual 
speech recognition database cuave several 
methods lip-localization proposed 
researchers here base colour distribution 
skin lips expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project develop program localization 
lip-region static colour images approach 
based using colour-distribution lips 
can employed program should take colour 
image file input localize lips extract 
lip-region output image file program 
should tested colour images talking 
persons cuave database clean green noisy 
background program should developed 
c c preferably matlab environment fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  develop 
program matlab environment  tests performed 
images clean background only  enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 development additional method localizing 
lips  results produced developed program 
should evaluated comparing them those 
localized manually  project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
