third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title satellite simulation 
system student name h lo supervisor ajg 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist satellite 
communication system established support 
worlds telephone networks increasing 
use robotic system space allowed increase 
use independence satellite systems 
end small sets satellites released into 
atmosphere control ground base satellites 
themselves distributed themselves 
evenly around earth atmosphere though 
stationary orbit useful always possible 
due constant pull satellites earth's 
gravitational orbit also space debris 
solar winds can serious impact position 
satellites project simulate how set 
satellites base station determine positioning 
satellites each other equidistance 
each under impact these external forces 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 basic java program showing 2d earth surround 
satellites set buttons pressed make 
random impact satellites satellites 
then organise correction random error 
induced understanding dai relevance 
process intelligent systems space fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  project 
based very small incremental steps fall 
back position reduce satellite system 
one satellite one base controller  method 
movement restrict left right moving 
round edge planet  3d dimension tangential 
forces added later date fall back position 
undertaken  emphasis refocused toward 
interface background enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  increase number 
satellites  remove base controller allow 
satellites sort difficulties themselves 
 improved user interface project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
