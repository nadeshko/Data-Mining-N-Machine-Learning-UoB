third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title finite difference 
calculation ferroelectric materials 
student name l c cheng supervisor mjl 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist finite 
difference method well know linear materials 
however ferroelectrics permittivity 
dependant upon applied voltage consequences 
impedance transmission line where ferroelectric 
used insulating materials expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 outcome project finite difference calculation 
ferroelectric materials calculation 
show voltage any point cross section 
microstrip transmission line given 
relationship between permittivity 
voltage ferroelectric material fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  constant 
permittivity calculation electric 
field  calculation impedance microstrip 
constant permittivity enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives

based calculations project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project
