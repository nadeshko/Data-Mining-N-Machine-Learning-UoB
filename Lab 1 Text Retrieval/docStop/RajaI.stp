third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title diagnosis automobile 
fault detection student name raja supervisor 
mo project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
nowadays detection faults any vehicle 
based analysis signals vehicle's black 
box associated some fault interpreter 
maps signal physical world unfortunately 
often occurs due some inconsistency 
signal testing device interpretation 
fault wrong motivates probabilistic 
approach diagnosis where outcome rather 
likelihood given physical fault right 
interpretation signal fault expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project design provide quantitative 
diagnosis platform interpreting faulty 
signal issued vehicle's black box expected 
experimental setup designed performing 
testing probabilistic diagnosis algorithm 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 design experimental setup makes diagnosis 
vehicle's fault detection interpretation 
useful  design implement probabilistic 
diagnosis scheme agrees vehicle's requirements 
 provide basis testing validating introduced 
algorithm  evaluate performance terms 
accuracy rightness algorithm outcomes 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  provide rational explanation 
performance algorithms respect different 
parameters  compare algorithm potential 
other candidates  propose future recommendations 
performances algorithm show some limitations 
methods actually use automobile industry 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
