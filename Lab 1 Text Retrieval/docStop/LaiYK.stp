data acquisition system student name 
lai yuen kit supervisor dr f huang project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist project specified 
entirely student having failed find 
supervisor specializes area realizes 
use experience enthusiasm lieu close 
supervision ethernet-based data acquisition 
system device can collect data one end 
send data via ethernet connection computer/server 
computer/server collects publishes 
data via web server internet users able 
read data using web browser internet 
connection regardless where stay expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project design construct microcontroller-based 
data acquisition device able communicate 
via ethernet server/computer publish 
its data via web server fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  able build data acquisition 
system device  able demonstrate understanding 
network protocol like tcp/ip stack enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 able recalibrate control data acquisition 
system device via web browser  device 
able function web server project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially
