third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title virtual environment 
control/display system supervision 
teleoperation multiple semi-autonomous 
vehicles games engine  real-time rendering 
system student name chris collis supervisor 
rjs project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
effective display  real-time  objects 
events three dimensional space situational 
awareness purposes gaining considerable 
support number important application 
domains air traffic control deployment 
semi-autonomous air subsea vehicles 
however human factor only given basic 
consideration design proposals such 
systems typically resulting very cluttered 
confusing displays poor interactivity 
project performed conjunction undertaken 
another beng student  tim kallay  address 
development underlying three-dimensional 
rendering software package suitable 
integration emerging hci concepts supporting 
appropriate ai behaviours package based 
games engine program either developed 
scratch using modified down-loadable 
example web eg unreal ii expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  main aim 
project implement 3d virtual world rendering 
system complete dynamic objects representing 
semi-autonomous vehicles using games 
engine technologies methodologies 
rendering system capable displaying 
behaviours simulated semi-autonomous 
underwater vehicles performing autonomously 
under direct control human user basic 
functions such collision detection 
also implemented rendering system designed 
interface hci ai subroutines being generated 
tim kally fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives  simplified engine capable 
supporting display basic preprogrammed-path 
vehicle representations no ai support 
joystick interface option enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 addition visual enhancements eg pixel 
shading terrain mapping  enhanced underlying 
physics engine  development separate 
vehicle entities via network connection 
 enhanced 3d engine project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
