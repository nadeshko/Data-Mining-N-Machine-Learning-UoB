third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title piezoelectric 
helical resonators student name ms v 
soon supervisor dr p smith project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
helical resonator normally metallic 
wire wound into helix becomes resonant 
electrically 1/2 wavelength long such 
resonators used many years both satellite 
communications mobile comms because 
can produce very compact resonators 
project investigate possibility using 
helical piezoelectric devices produced 
irc materials application dc voltage 
causes helix change shape slightly thus 
may alter frequency resonator using 
such devices may possible achieve electronic 
tuning these types resonators expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project build piezoelectric helical 
resonator where resonant frequency 
device can changed application dc voltage 
careful consideration given application 
dc biasing voltage how can achieved without 
degrading microwave performance most 
important aim project should fail-safe 
system no way anyone could exposed dangerous 
voltage another aim could investigate 
tuning range device versus applied voltage 
temperature stability resonator could 
also investigated fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  simple analytic modeling 
resonator could undertaken practical 
problems  sophisticated modeling could 
undertaken using finite difference 
programme enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  different types piezoelectric 
helical resonators could investigated 
some may larger amounts movement may 
lower overall q  modelling resonators 
could undertaken using finite difference 
programme project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
