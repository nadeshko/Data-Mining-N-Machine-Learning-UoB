third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title localization 
via mobile devices gps versus mast/transmitters 
student name adam bronks supervisor 
mo project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
due widespread mobile devices nowadays 
use these device people monitoring emergency 
handling becomes than necessary especially 
these devices can used localizing people 
stress other purposes other hand economical 
perspective tendency use low cost devices 
monitoring purpose candidate technologies 
purpose use gps devices simply use information 
related masts transmitter locations 
expected outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project provide qualitative and/or 
quantitative comparison performance 
localization techniques using either 
gps design incorporated into mobile 
devices use cheap information transmitter/masts 
locations expected experimental setup 
designed performing comparison according 
multitude factors whether condition 
traffic load number transmitters available 
proximity transmitters also range localization 
techniques tested include triangulation 
linear estimation among kalman filter 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 design experimental setup makes comparison 
useful enhances different above parameters 
 design implement different localization 
techniques associated performances 
respect true position mobile device 
 provide set recommendations community 
regarding best localization technique 
used respect different parameters  provide 
performance terms accuracy different 
algorithms enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  provide rational explanation 
performance algorithms respect different 
parameters  propose future recommendations 
improving localizations tools using 
either gps transmitters locations project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
