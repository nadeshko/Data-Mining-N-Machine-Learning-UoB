project title:impact avoidance system 
student name:w.k.chan supervisor:ms 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist impact 
avoidance systems expensive pieces 
hardware can encompass vision systems 
proximity detectors etc involve both 
sensor system motor controlled platform 
hardware mounted however use vision 
avoid impact involves development sophisticated 
real-time algorithms whose robustness 
questionable project involves development 
simple system probably based ultrasound 
detects possible impact based proximity 
velocity expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  project develop pic-based system 
able detect object front sensor object 
moving rapidly towards sensor collision 
path application project active vision 
platform containing expensive pieces 
hardware such system tracks moving objects 
using vision processing objects collision 
course vision processing must detect 
send signal motors controlling platform 
take evasive action involves fairly 
complex processing cheaper alternative 
envisaged based pic microcontroller 
using simple ultrasonic proximity sensor 
demonstration system should built involving 
simple dc motor controlled pic fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  interfacing 
proximity sensor pic enabling distance 
object measured  determining velocity 
object enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  mounting system motor controlled 
platform  different threat levels  emitting 
warning tones project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please 
confirm uniqueness project placing
