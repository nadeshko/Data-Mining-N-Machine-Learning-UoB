Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: Comparative study of Cuk converter


Student Name: Kee Wong


Supervisor: SVMollov




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
Cuk converter is nowadays used as a high power rectifier. In this project we want to study the performance of three possible topologies.



Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
Compare the performance of three types of Cuk converter
Po=200W Vo=15V Vin=50V


Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Design Cuk converter: conventional circuit, transformer isolated circuit and integrated magnetics circuit

* 

Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* Build and test conventional Cuk converter:   2.2

* Build and test transformer isolated Cuk converter:  2.1

* Build and test integrated magnetics converter: first


Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
