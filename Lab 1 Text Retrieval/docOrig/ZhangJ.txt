Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title:   Empirical equation for the resonant frequency and coupling coefficient of  microstrip double-spiral resonators

Student Name:  Jun Jie Zhang


Supervisor:  FH




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)

Microstrip spiral resonators in filters are currently designed by computer simulation, which is a lengthy process.  It would be helpful to have empirical design equations, similar to those for straight microstrip,  at least to provide an initial design or a feasibility study.  This can be done by fitting a curves to simulated results, probably using the SONNET electromagnetic simulator.  To be useful, the equations must be valid for a wide range of permittivity, number of turns, substrate thickness, etc.


Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 

1. Provide empirical design equations, together with simulation data to demonstrate validity.
2. Use Physical arguments to show proportionality (or other simple relationship) between some of the parameters and resonant frequency, thereby simplifying the equations.
3. Review the theory of resonant transmission lines, and use it for (2).
4. Demonstrate a knowledge of SONNET (or other) electromagnetic simulator.


Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Provide design data in the form of graphs

* Review the theory of resonant transmission lines.

* Demonstrate a knowledge of SONNET (or other) electromagnetic simulator.


Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)

As with "expected outcomes", but extend the work to coupling coefficients between spirals.



Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.

Other than learning standard theory and software, there is enough unique material provided the expected outcomes are met.

Student Name:  Agbamu Evans


Supervisor:  FH




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)

The above coupling capacitances have previously been calculated using quasi-static methods.  They are now to be verified using an electromagnetic simulator.  Although this has also been done in a previous project, more user-friendly software should now enable much further progress to be made.

1.Design data, mainly coupling capacitances, to be provided for a range of gap sizes, line widths and substrate permittivities, and compared with the results available in the literature.
2. An upper frequency limit for the quasi-static model to be evaluated from the data.
3.  Use of the electromagnetic simulator, and calculations based on the data obtained, to be explained.

Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.

Project Title:   Basic voice scrambler for privacy


Student Name: The Aik  NG


Supervisor:  FH




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)

	A voice scrambler, which divides the speech spectrum into frequency bands and shifts their positions, can be implemented using time-domain operations alone,  resulting in a very efficient algorithm which uses only about eight multiplications per sample.  Processing has to be carried out digitally but the transmission, over a phone line, can be analog.

	This scrambler is to be implemented using a processor such as the Mitsubishi 16C/62.  It repeats a project by Paul Neumann about 12 years ago, but new hardware available will change the character of the job completely.  A more recent attempt (C.P. Johnson) has left much undone, so there is still a lot of new material to be covered. 


Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 

A demonstration circuit, suitable for lectures and open days, is to be built. Experiments are to be carried out to find the best combination of parameters for optimum performance.  A further study is to find the effective number of distinct keys.


Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)

* Demonstrate proficiency with the microprocessor in inputting and outputting data, and doing some simple operations such as frequency shifting.


Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)

* Produce a hard wired, stand-alone circuit.
