Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) 


Student Name: Ms W Wang 


Supervisor: Dr P A Smith




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)
High permittivity Dielectric Resonator Antennas (DRA's) are attractive at lower frequencies as they provide the ability to substantially reduce the size of the antenna. This is because the dimensions of the antenna are reduced by a factor of 1/((r. However if the (r is too large then the efficiency and the effective bandwidth of the antenna can become too small. There is therefore a need to effectively model and design such antennas. If separate antennas are used for TX and RX then narrow bandwidths of perhaps 3% are quite viable. 



Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 
The aim of this project is to study and model the performance of a high permittivity DRA. This could involve looking at the different modes present in DRA's of different shapes. This may be done using the cavity model and the software package Matlab. If the project goes well then the outcomes are accurate predictions of: 
* resonant frequency;
* input impedance 
* radiation patterns. 
For perhaps several different modes and shapes of dielectric?

Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Predict the resonant frequency of the antenna assuming the DRA has perfect magnetic walls

* Predict the resonant frequency with greater accuracy by taking into account the fringing fields at the edges of the DRA. 

* 


Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* Design a dual frequency RX single polarization DRA for GSM  900 & 1800
* Design a dual polarization single frequency RX DRA for GSM 1800
* 

Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
