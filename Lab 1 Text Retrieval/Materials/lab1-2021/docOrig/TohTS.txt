                  Third Year BEng Final Year Design Project - 2003/2004

Project Title: Motor Control Laboratory Experiment


Student Name: TS Toh


Supervisor: Dr A J Forsyth




Project Specification:
Background. (Please include a general scene-setting overview of the project - targeted at the non-specialist)

To support the teaching of second year electrical power, a new lab experiment is required to enable students to study the operation and control of both brushed and brushless DC motors.







Expected Outcomes. (Please include a specification for the expected outcomes of this project when undertaken by an average student.   e.g. 'The aim of this project is to design and ....') 

A two loop controller and power converter are to be designed, built and tested for a small brushed DC motor, which is coupled to a brushless machine giving the possibility of demonstrating motoring and regenerative operation.





Fallback and Rebuild Position. (Students sometimes have difficulty in delivering the stated outcomes.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of minimal target objectives.)
* Basic system understood and design completed

* DC-DC converter operational and basic control loops implemented

* 


Enhancement Position. (It is anticipated that many students will achieve the expected outcomes stated above.   Using bullet points, please list a suitable set of achievable enhancement objectives.)
* Robust system design that is well understood

* Operation in motor and regenerative modes

* Computer control of the system


Project Uniqueness:   It is expected that all projects should be essentially unique (at least 80% of the project content).   Thus a student should not be able to meet the project outcomes by reproducing material from previous project reports.   Please confirm the uniqueness of this project by placing a tick in the adjacent box.
