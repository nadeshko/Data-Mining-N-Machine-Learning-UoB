clive roberts project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
jaguar requirement testing diagnosing 
faults on-board can modules used control 
aspects vehicle's operation spy system 
consist testing module associated software 
required allow jaguar test set modules 
system validation during development 
support processes jaguar provide test 
modules technical support expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project design construct can spy 
system system should capable identifying 
modules can network polling those identified 
turn order ascertain potential fault 
conditions modules themselves already 
configured report own related modules 
fault codes system programmed using 
jaguar's asl software programming library 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 demonstrate basic understanding can 
system  construct basic hardware necessary 
connection four modules should enable 
module plugged system test enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 jaguar prefer test diagnosis test automated 
possible exceptional project explore 
requirement further attempt produces 
system near production possible likely 
include automated reporting functionality 
look-up tables different fault codes 
 provide system level rather than module 
level fault diagnosis achieved considering 
types modules installed interconnection 
project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
