third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title hf transmitter 
receiver small antennas student name 
richard murrian supervisor pra project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist oceanographers 
deploy wide range buoys monitoring climatic 
biomass related parameters these may 
connected via low-earth orbit satellites 
extreme expense via vhf radio link typically 
limited about 10 km alternative using 
clusters buoys open ocean environments 
use hf surface-wave propagation channels 
however approach feasible need low-cost 
power-efficient transmitter-receiver 
capable signaling rates approaching 
100 k bits per second whilst driving electrically 
short antennas expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design  aim project design 
build power-efficient receiver based 
tayloe mixer analysis system performance 
should carried device capable operating 
single frequency 15  30 mhz band thus set 
design guidelines produced showing 
suitable compromise between power consumption 
frequency stability strong-signal 
performance noise-limited performance 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 build test tayloe detector mixer using 
fast bus switches driving device standard 
laboratory signal sources  build test 
receiver pre-mixer filter optimized 
use electrically small antenna  build 
test rf preamplifier good strong-signal 
performance enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  investigate capabilities 
analog devices direct digital synthesis 
dds integrated circuits use local-oscillator 
source  consider performance benefits 
resulting spur-reduction output dds 
resulting use narrow-band filters local-oscillator 
signal path  design build matching transmitter 
capable driving 5w into electrically-short 
antenna project uniqueness expected 
projects should essentially unique 
least 80 project content thus student 
should able meet project outcomes reproducing 
material previous project reports please
