third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title suppression 
noise speech signals student name gurdeepak 
chana supervisor peter jancovic project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist current speech 
recognition systems can achieve good 
recognition performance speech recorded 
noise-free environment however real 
world speech signal usually corrupted 
various types background environmental 
noises under noisy conditions recognition 
performance speech recognition systems 
usually significantly decreases project 
aim incorporating several typical noise 
reduction techniques into speech recognition 
process expected outcomes please include 
specification expected outcomes project 
undertaken average student e.g aim project 
design  aim project develop several methods 
noise-reduction speech signals methods 
such spectral subtraction wiener filtering 
should considered implementation should 
c c language input program should wav 
file containing raw speech samples spectral-based 
feature parameterization input file 
should implemented de-noised file should 
stored methods developed should evaluated 
passing de-noised speech signals speech 
recognition toolbox tool provided evaluation 
various noisy conditions should performed 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 develop noise reduction methods matlab 
environment  either spectral subtraction 
wiener filtering should implemented 
 input program could instead wav speech 
file sequence spectral features enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 several modifications spectral subtraction 
wiener filtering techniques should 
developed evaluated  additional technique 
should developed e.g wavelet-based 
de-noising rasta filtering  project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
