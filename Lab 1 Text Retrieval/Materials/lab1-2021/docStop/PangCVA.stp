specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist evolution 
telecommunication systems especially 
mobile terrestrial satellite communication 
domains led hardened constraints terms 
selectivity electrical performances 
bulk reduction planar filters therefore 
development highly selective filters 
low insertion losses rapidly expanding 
area activity expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student

characteristics high frequency band-pass 
filter enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement
