third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title diver-held 
fishing net detection sonar student 
name lawrence brown supervisor pra project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist many parts 
world local fishermen use nets made fine 
mono-filament nylon line these tend 
deployed beaches small boats can extend 
over significant distances nets neutrally 
buoyant therefore drift currents significant 
quantities netting material inevitably 
get swept away result storms mismanagement 
fishermen net then becomes significant 
hazard sports divers marine mammals 
virtually undetectable once entrapped 
virtually impossible escape expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project design build technology-demonstrator 
sonar system using single transmit beam 
two-transducer split-beam receiver 
anticipated demonstration implemented 
using matlab pc some suitable method 
interfacing signals pc should demonstrated 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 measure impedance sonar transducer 
using circle-diagram plotter then drive 
device using conventional laboratory 
arbitrary signal generator  build simple 
low-noise receive preamplifier  input 
receive signals pc possibly using national 
instruments a/d card demonstrate simple 
matched filter matlab enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  consider matching 
requirements simple resonant transducer 
implement third-order matching network 
improve transmission bandwidth  consider 
advantages disadvantages using stack 
two ceramics low-cost production environment 
order increase transmission bandwidth 
 interface high-speed a/d converter 
possibly using usb device pc matlab consider 
off-loading some down-conversion tasks 
dsp such blackfin demonstrate processing-load 
improvements such move project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
