third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title wireless voice 
control server using personal digital 
assistant implementing speech recognition 
student name j rossiter supervisor professor 
m russel project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
future speech recognition important 
interaction between users computers 
much what implemented to-date concerned 
speech recognition desktop computer 
much progress pocket platform using 
pocket pc such compaq ipaq(tm allows 
user mobility compromised inadequate 
data input output methods using speech 
recognition hoped these problems can 
avoided however typical pocket pc does 
sufficient computing power memory support 
full speech recognition goal project 
develop distributed speech recognition 
ipaq whereby user talks ipaq some representation 
speech transmitted pc recognized result 
returned ipaq way pocket computer can 
interact normal pc order perform tasks 
separately impossible due mobility 
computer terrible power pocket pc powerful 
enough perform full speech recognition 
link between two can standard known system 
such wireless network data must transferred 
between two successfully without error 
use pocket pc wireless network allows 
user wander through wireless enabled 
area whilst still effectively using 
power computer base station expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 1 understand relevant aspects networking 
speech recognition 2 implement pc-based 
speech recognition system 3 decide parts 
speech recognition process should implemented 
ipaq should implemented pc 4 design implement 
evaluate method passing speech data 
ipaq speech recognition system pc 5 integrate 
speech recognition touch screen input 
ipaq fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 items 1 3 4 constitute minimal set objectives 
some progress 2 should also made enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 ipaq(tm support full speech recognition 
dictation achieved using toolkit implemented 
server pc  server pc listen voice commands 
ipaq(tm order perform tasks hardware 
connected pc including bank lights show 
remote use computer peripherals project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
