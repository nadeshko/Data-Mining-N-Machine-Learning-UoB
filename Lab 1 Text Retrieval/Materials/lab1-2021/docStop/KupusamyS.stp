third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title tactile discrimination 
computer generated braille characters 
using glove-mounted tactile-feedback 
transducer student name sujan kupusamy 
supervisor prof bob stone project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
user wears glove sensor fingertip moves 
hand pad air virtual environment software 
brings forth movement into environment 
user touches braille characters virtual 
environment he/she could feel senses 
other words sensor creates touch feedback 
braille characters glove expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  aim project 
design virtual environment blind learn 
braille characters lot could able sense 
textures characters learn using computer 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 using i-feel mouse instead glove tactile 
feedback  generate several shapes replacing 
braille characters  use other virtual 
reality software enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  use many sensors 
fingers thumb  use sound give feedback 
user  use many environments teaching 
tool project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
