third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title dual-band chebyshev 
impedance transformer student name 
usamah yaseen supervisor dr h ghafour-shiraz 
project specification background please 
include general scene-setting overview 
project  targeted non-specialist impedance 
matching classical topic microwave 
engineering arises wide variety microwave 
system many cases practical interest 
including dual-band mobile telephony 
impedance matching over two separated 
bands required expected outcomes please 
include specification expected outcomes 
project undertaken average student 
e.g aim project design  aim project therefore 
design dual-band impedance transformer 
based chebyshev synthesis single-band 
transformer fallback rebuild position 
students sometimes difficulty delivering 
stated outcomes using bullet points 
please list suitable set minimal target 
objectives    enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  design dual-band impedance 
transformer based chebyshev synthesis 
single-band transformer   project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
