third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title efficiency 
measurement antennas student name c 
x ang supervisor professor p s hall project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist performance 
antennas mobile phones primarily characterised 
measuring its efficiency traditionally 
efficiency measured using wheeler cap 
method input resistance antenna free 
space metal box compared however method 
inaccurate box modes significant new 
data processing method described overcomes 
problem aim project investigate new 
method existing antennas made communications 
engineering group measured measurement 
involve use vector network analyser 
data analysis done using matlab expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
  wheeler cap apparatus built  reference 
antennas made measured efficiency  some 
multi-band antennas measured  assessment 
accuracy  investigation results comparison 
traditional new method fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  building wheeler 
cap apparatus  design make reference 
antennas  efficiency measurement reference 
antennas enhancement position anticipated 
many students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  comparison anechoic chamber 
method reverberation chamber method 
 project uniqueness expected projects 
should essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material
