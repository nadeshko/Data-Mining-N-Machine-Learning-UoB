third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title safety emulation 
system household appliances student 
name d lam supervisor ajg project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
different appliance can differing power 
supplies surges occurs number different 
appliance switch same time even demands 
power supply system intelligent agents 
each representing household appliance 
networked allow surges faults detected 
well measures control machine demands 
alert owner possible problems expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 project basic level simple centralised 
dai system central controlling agent 
agent communicate other agents network 
agents these agents report problems 
demands decision over demands determined 
controlling agent basic deliverables 
1 uml design 2 visual basic problem demonstrate 
interaction between controller other 
distributed agents 3 demonstration 
fault one units produce suitable solution 
fallback rebuild position students 
sometimes difficulty delivering stated 
outcomes using bullet points please 
list suitable set minimal target objectives 
 demonstration vb program can communicate 
another vb program  information sent 
can analysed processed make reaction 
network vb programs  scheduling vb program 
controlled controlling program  identification 
information between program indicate 
severity information application fire 
given higher priority than application 
requiring less power enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives 1 understanding 
power issues related demands placed 
upon supply i.e mathematical 2 removal 
centralised controller agents negotiate 
amongst themselves 3 transference basic 
idea complex context project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project
