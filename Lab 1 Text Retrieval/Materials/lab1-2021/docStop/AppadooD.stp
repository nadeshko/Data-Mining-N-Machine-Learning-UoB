third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title software definable 
radio link student name d appadoo supervisor 
ccc project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
software definable radio sdr promising 
new technology potential revolutionise 
radio communications standardizing 
radio hardware down minimal hardware 
technology exploiting flexibility 
software power digital signal processors 
create adaptive radio scans adopts available 
air interface standard expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design  aim project 
design build test pair hand-held battery-powered 
radio transmitter receivers each based 
around sharc board these should support 
qpsk fsk modulation 64kb/s continuous 
nrz data bit stream fallback rebuild 
position students sometimes difficulty 
delivering stated outcomes using bullet 
points please list suitable set minimal 
target objectives  decide unlicensed 
band use view minimize project complexity 
cost  design build demonstrate simple 
transmitter receiver architecture 
 manually set desired modulation schemes 
enhancement position anticipated many 
students achieve expected outcomes 
stated above using bullet points please 
list suitable set achievable enhancement 
objectives  implement advanced transceiver 
architecture can compensate inter-symbol 
interference time-variant channel 
 implement auto-modulation scheme recognition 
facility receiver together necessary 
signaling support transmitter project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
