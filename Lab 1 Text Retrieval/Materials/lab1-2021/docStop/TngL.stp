third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title 1.03 ghz high 
power pulse transmitter light aircraft 
id systems student name l.c.s tng supervisor 
pg project specification background 
please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
communications/id system required 
small un-powered aircraft such gliders 
hot air balloons ensure safe collisions 
other larger aircraft system currently 
envisaged calls low duty cycle high peak 
power pulses transmitted carrier frequency 
1.03 ghz project investigate suitable 
approaches problem designing highly 
efficient compact transmitter antenna 
systems suitable task expected outcomes 
please include specification expected 
outcomes project undertaken average 
student e.g aim project design   research 
system requirements power efficiency 
size cost etc  design suitable 1.03 ghz 
power amplifier very high efficiency 
class  design purchase appropriate antenna 
compatible system requirements  integrate 
two designs build test them unit fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  design 
simple 1.03 ghz antenna suitable application 
build measure its properties   enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 demonstrate pulsed operation integrated 
module  carry detailed theoretical analysis 
antenna/amplifier interaction  compare 
effects interaction between antenna 
amplifier different classes amplifier 
different forms antenna project uniqueness 
expected projects should essentially 
unique least 80 project content thus 
student should able meet project outcomes 
reproducing material previous project 
reports please confirm uniqueness project
