third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title dielectric 
resonator antenna dra student name ms 
w wang supervisor dr p smith project specification 
background please include general scene-setting 
overview project  targeted non-specialist 
high permittivity dielectric resonator 
antennas dra's attractive lower frequencies 
provide ability substantially reduce 
size antenna because dimensions antenna 
reduced factor 1/((r however r too large 
then efficiency effective bandwidth 
antenna can become too small therefore 
need effectively model design such antennas 
separate antennas used tx rx then narrow 
bandwidths perhaps 3 quite viable expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project study model performance 
high permittivity dra could involve 
looking different modes present dra's 
different shapes may done using cavity 
model software package matlab project 
goes well then outcomes accurate predictions 
 resonant frequency  input impedance 
 radiation patterns perhaps several 
different modes shapes dielectric fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  predict 
resonant frequency antenna assuming 
dra perfect magnetic walls  predict resonant 
frequency greater accuracy taking into 
account fringing fields edges dra  enhancement 
position anticipated many students 
achieve expected outcomes stated above 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set achievable enhancement objectives 
 design dual frequency rx single polarization 
dra gsm 900  1800  design dual polarization 
single frequency rx dra gsm 1800  project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
