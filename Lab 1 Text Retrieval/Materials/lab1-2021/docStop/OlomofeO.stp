third year beng final year design project 
 2003/2004 project title detection speech 
sound recordings student name olusegun 
olomofe supervisor peter jancovic project 
specification background please include 
general scene-setting overview project 
 targeted non-specialist task sound 
retrieval system find occurrence some 
sound-of-interest large amount recordings 
example may interested detection speech 
recorded sound e.g sound track movie 
project investigate methods detection 
speech such recorded sounds may possibly 
contain various types non-speech signals 
such various noises action music expected 
outcomes please include specification 
expected outcomes project undertaken 
average student e.g aim project design 
 aim project investigate develop program 
detection speech signals recordings 
contain various types sounds e.g stationary 
 non-stationary background noise music 
input program waveform signal wav file 
student need parameterize input signal 
into sequence spectral-based frame 
features program consist two phases 
training testing training phase models 
speech feature-space estimated gaussian 
mixture modeling gmm performed clean 
speech database both gmm tool clean speech 
database provided testing initially 
speech signal should inserted random 
positions into mixture non-speech signals 
student should create database various 
non-speech sounds then tests should 
carried real-world data e.g sound track 
movie results obtained should evaluated 
comparing them those obtained manually 
i.e location speech present real-world 
data should manually annotated fallback 
rebuild position students sometimes 
difficulty delivering stated outcomes 
using bullet points please list suitable 
set minimal target objectives  program 
developed matlab environment  speech 
parameterization implemented  provided 
parameterization used  only initial 
testing performed enhancement position 
anticipated many students achieve expected 
outcomes stated above using bullet points 
please list suitable set achievable 
enhancement objectives  program developed 
c c language  both types testing performed 
real-world data testing database least 
one hour should obtained annotated  investigation 
using segment-based features project 
uniqueness expected projects should 
essentially unique least 80 project 
content thus student should able meet 
project outcomes reproducing material 
previous project reports please confirm
